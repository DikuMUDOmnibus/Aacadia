0 "DUAL WIELD"~
&RSyntax: &gAutomatic Skill
 
&gCharacters with this skill are able to wield two weapons at once.  To
&gdo so, the character must remove any 'held' item and any shield, then
&gsimply wield two weapons.  Characters with strength under 25 may be
&gunable to dual wield two very heavy weapons.
 
&gOnce two weapons are wielded, the affects of the skill are automatic.

&gMultiplaying is not allowed. Do not do it. If caught, you can be helled, set

be deleted, upon discression of the imm who cathes you. The only exception is
when a Host, Host Senior or Host Admin says you may multiplay, but this will
be very rare and usually for testing purposes.&D

800 ''IMM AUTH' 'IMM AUTHORIZE'~
Associated help files: authorize
 
Authorize <player> name -- This is the command used to allow a player to
  continue in the Spectral Gate pre-auth area, but will make them choose
  a new name prior to entering the Academy.  Use this command if the name
  is questionable, modern, or rude.  If the name is acceptible, but in all
  caps, accept the name, but send them a tell requesting they not use all
  caps for their name in the future.
 
Authorize <player> yes -- This is used to accept a players name.  Once this
  command is used, the player requires no further Immortal commands to enter
  the Realms.
 
Authorize <player> no -- This command is exclusively used to deny players
  with extremely rude or profane names and banned sites.  Use this command
  sparingly.
 
All Immortals should periodically type 'authorize' to assure their are not any
players waiting for authorization.  The new system allows the Immortals a
bit of time to decide if an name is appropriate before accepting or denying
it.  If you are in doubts to a names acceptibilty, but it is not profane or
extremely modern, you should probably accept it.

800 AASSIGN~
&RSyntax:&g aassign <filename>.are  Example:  aassign edo.are
 
AASSIGN temporarily assigns all rooms, objects, and mobiles in the area
range to your pfile.  This allows you to use rlist, olist, mlist, and
reset list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or 
instazone will affect this area.  
 
To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
&rWarning&w!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.
 
In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you by a Greater God or higher.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by an Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed
only Lesser+ can aassign themselves nonproto areas.

800 'ABATTOIR ASYLUM'~
&g
Recommended level range: 35 - 50

Once a monument to health and sanity, the Abbot Hill Asylum has been
corrupted over the years and now lies in a state of irrepairable decay.
Located on a large isle in the Blood Sea, the insane and dying were once
brought there to be healed and cared for. Unfortunately, it seems that the
priests in care of these decrepit souls were infected by the same lack of
sanity they were attempting to cure. What was once a place of peace and
salvation has become a haven of the damned, ruled by chaos unbridled.

800 ABEIL~
&gAbeil are insect-like humanoids known for their industriousness and their
complex social structure. They are commonly referred to as "bee people." 
Their society has an expansionist philosophy - a fact that troubles those

to overcome rivals through superior resourcefulness and industry.

0 'ACETUM PRIMUS'~
&RSyntax: &gcast 'acetum primus' <target>
 
'Acetum Primus,' is the third and most powerful of the known acid
disciplines at the Mage's disposal.  This incantation pulls forth the
strongest caustic agents in the casting Mage's neighboring planes,
and propels them in a tight cyclone-like blast towards the Mage's
chosen victim.  The cross-dimensional disturbance, the physical
violence, and the bonescouring potency of the conjured compound all
work together to effect an estimable estrapade.
 
~

1 'ACID BLAST' 'COLOUR SPRAY' FIREBALL 'LIGHTNING BOLT' 'MAGIC MISSILE' 'SHOCKING GRASP'~
&gThese are all attack spells and should not be used against another player
unless both you and the other player are listed under 'who deadly' and are
within the legal pkill level range.

1) &RSyntax:&g  cast fireball         <victim>
2) &RSyntax:&g  cast 'acid blast'     <victim>
4) &RSyntax:&g  cast 'colour spray'   <victim>
5) &RSyntax:&g  cast 'shocking grasp' <victim>
6) &RSyntax:&g  cast 'magic missile'  <victim>
 
Each of these spells inflict variable damage on the victim.  The higher the
caster's level, the more damage inflicted.  The spells are listed by their
inherent power from strongest to weakest, though differences in strength
are in many cases minimal.
~

0 'ACID BREATH' 'FIRE BREATH' 'FROST BREATH' 'GAS BREATH' 'LIGHTNING BREATH'~
&RSyntax:&g cast 'acid breath'      <victim>
&RSyntax:&g cast 'fire breath'      <victim>
&RSyntax:&g cast 'frost breath'     <victim>
&RSyntax:&g cast 'gas breath'
&RSyntax:&g cast 'lightning breath' <victim>

These spells are for the use of dragons.  Acid, fire, frost, and lightning
damage one victim, whereas gas damages every PC in the room.  Fire and
frost can break objects, and acid can damage armor.

High level mages may learn and cast these spells as well.
 
Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.
Gas breath is an area attack, the other breath spells are not.

0 ACOLYTE~
&gAfter wandering the realm for a certain amount of time, some people 
can reach such a high level of power that it becomes almost 
impossible for ordinary mortals to imagine. These people have come 
to be known as the Acolytes of Kara's Storm.  There are even rumors 
flying around that even if a person tried, they couldn't reach any 
higher without divine intervention.

~

800 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction, as well as
the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one, use
a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
  redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to refer to
it by number:
  redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
  (to know what number an exit is, do an "rstat")
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one of
the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It's also usually a good idea
to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer to those
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
  redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
  redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
  redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
  ... here, if a player types 'swim' in the room they will move to room 3001

0 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
&RSyntax:&g  affected       (abbrevation:  af)
&RSyntax:&g  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)
 
'Affected' is a spells-at-a-glance function, which displays only the spells
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <spell/skill name> or 'score').
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its spell/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.
~

800 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~
&gThe following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item

   to modify the players hitroll by +5 and their ac by -10.

0 ALIA ALIAS UNALIAS~
&RSyntax:&g alias <shortcut> <command>
&RSyntax:&g alias <shortcut>

YOU CAN USE ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) for alias command shortcuts!

The ALIAS command allows you to set shortcuts for commands or long
strings of text. These can be quite useful for shortening routinely
entered commands. Example: alias heal cast heal samson
This assigns the command 'cast heal samson' to the alias 'heal'
so that typing in 'heal' will issue the full command.
You can create up to &R200&g aliases.

To use multiple commands in your alias, type this before the second
command ---> : ie alias test chat testing:chat testing.
 
Typing ALIAS with no arguments will list your current aliases.
Your aliases will save with your character upon leaving the game.
An alias may contain a shortcut for a several command's. If more
sophisticated aliases are needed, a mud client package would probably
serve the purpose better.

EXAMPLE: alias lite cast 'continual light:give ball %1:
EXAMPLE: alias mob e:bs %1:throw %1:kick %1:
  
To remove an alias, type 'UNALIAS' followed by the alias name you wish
to remove.
 
IF you find a problem in Alias, post a note to the bug board and let us know.
 
Please inform Nicole or Swiftsword!
~

0 ALIAS-VARIABLES~
&g'ALIAS VARIABLES'
 
You may use variables, or parameters, in your aliases.  Basically,
what this means is that you can put a placeholder in your aliases
which will be replaced with something you type (or nothing if you
do not specify a replacement).
  
To do this, use a %1-5 in your aliases.  A good way to think of
how it will work is this:
  
        %1     %2     %3     %4     %5
alias <text> <text> <text> <text> <text>
 
For example:    alias greet smile %1:bow %1:say Hello %1:
If you typed:   greet Friend
It would be like your alias said: smile Friend;mbow Friend;say Hello Friend!
 
NOTE: Just because you used a %# in your alias, you do not always have
              to enter something to replace it.
 
Using the above 'greet' example, if you only typed greet, it would act
as if the alias said:  smile:bow:say Hello:
Note that you may not create an alias that calls on another alias.

2 ALIGNMENT ALIGN ZAPPING~
Your alignment can range from +1000 to -1000. When you are +1000 this
means that you are good aligned, when you are -1000 this means you are
evil aligned, and when you are 0 aligned this means you are neutral.
You can change your alignment by killing good or evil aligned mobs.
This will raise or lower your alignment.

The different alignments will allow you to wear different pieces of
equipment. If you are good aligned and try to wear a piece of equipment
which is antigood, you will be zapped, which means the piece of eq will
fall to the ground. The same occurs when you are evil and you try to
wear an antievil piece of eq, or if you are neutral and try to wear
an antineutral piece of eq. You can also be zapped during battle if you
are fighting a mob opposite of your align.

You can find out what your alignment is by typing SCORE.

~

-1 ANGELCLASS ANG1~
.
&gThe Angels are a class of individuals who have chosen to sacrifice all mortal
possessions and their former ways of life, and have dedicated themselves to 
helping their fellow players.  Angels try to remain accessible and friendly 
to mortals, and will help when they can, but please remember that they are 
not your personal slaves, and they do have the whole mud to watch over.  

Angel aid also differs from the direct material aid often associated with 
the upper tiers.  Angels have given up fighting and getting equipment. Instead
they try to help with advice and guidance, as well as with CRs and emergency
situations.
 
Angels assist the Immortals in making &RKara's Storm&g a good place to play.
Angels cannot prevent mortals from encountering affliction and danger,
but they can and will help mortals learn to cope with such occurrences.
~

-1 ANGELPETITION ANG2~
&gANGELPETITION
 
Becoming an Angel of Kara's Storm is a career move which is not to be taken
lightly.  It involves giving up active playing on the chosen character and
devoting your time to helping out those who need it.  It is advised that you
think carefully before applying- that you are able to commit to the cause of
helping others. 
 
The following are steps which must be followed in order for you to apply for
the position of Angel.
 
 *Send a note to Kailin on the Personal Board stating why you wish to become
  an Angel and how you feel you will be able contribute to the experience
  of playing on Kara's Storm for new players.
 
 *Once you have received a reply from Kailin, follow the instructions she
  gives you regarding meeting time and place.
 
 *Meet Kailin at the time and place she asked you to.  Try not to be too
  late as it may not be in your favor :o)
 
I wish you all the best :o)
~

-1 ANGELREQ ANGELREQUIREMENT ANG3~
.
&gHere are the requirements to become an Angel. The first 2 are ones before 
applying and the next few are for when you receive your reply.
 
 1) Be at least Hero level 1.
 
 2) Have a decent knowledge of the areas and the game.

------------
 
 1) Remove all equipment.

 2) Sacrifice all equipment.
 
 3) Show up at the given time at the designated spot.
 
 4) Be prepared for some initial waiting.
 
 5) Read related responsibilities file.
~

-1 ANGELROLE ANG4~
&wOk, here are your responsibilities as an Angel. Please read carefully.
 
 1) Help with Corpse Retrievals when necessary.
 
 2) If an Immortal asks you to check on someone, do it.
 
 3) Restores at discretion. But please, not very frequently.
 
 4) No abusive bamfs. If you are caught with one, it is grounds for
immediate banning from the MUD.
 
 5) Angels are forbidden to join any Clans. Angels are here to help everyone,
and it would not seem proper if they had a tie to any 'team' or 'group'.
~

800 ANGELRULES~
&g
Here are a few rules you are obligated to follow as an Angel of Kara's Storm.
 
1) You are not allowed to use your Angel alt in ANY way to assist your alts or
   any groupies/friends.
 
2) As an Angel you don't need any spells practiced except continual light/
   bless. Please do not ask for any other spells as refusal often offends.
 
3) Angels are NOT to help mortals get gear, nor are they to fetch gear for
   them.
 
4) If you see someone die to a particularly aggie mob then you are obliged
   to help them retrieve the corpse. This does not mean quit playing your alts
   it just means make a little sacrifice of time to help the player out.
 
5) If you have any problems with players or members of staff then bring it to
   either mine or SwiftSword, Nicole, Khesekh's attention. Please dont take it
   upon yourselves to settle the score. It often has undeseriable effects for
   all parties involved. Lets all try to get along. :o)
 
If you have any suggestions, comments, or porblems with these rules take it
up with Galley. Thank you for your co-operation.

1 ANTARCTICA~
Recommended level range: 10 - 30

The frozen wastes of Antarctica lie far to the south of Koenraad,
separated from the main continent by a vast ocean. Hidden in this
land of ice is the town of Little Haven. Two great heroines of Light rule
over the gnomes of this town: the Shieldmaiden Brunhilde and the Snow
Queen. The gnomes have created deadly frost giants to aid in the 
protection of the town and have also enlisted the aid of a fearsome blue
dragon. It is a comforting thought that very little threat arises from
Antarctica, for the Realms are already dark enough...

.&OSalutations,&D
 
So! You want to be a Builder, eh?
Think you have the drive for it?
Think you have the Patience for it?
 
Very well. But you must also have a certain measure of creative talent,
to get anywhere in my books.
&g(7th June 2003)&D Especially now that we technically are fully staffed.
Normally 20% make it to actually Build. Just so you know.
 
If you want to be a Builder, if you want to reach the rank of Wizard here,
show me what you've got in you.
 
&YContact me!&D If you see me on ( and only if you see me on, no polling the 
other Immortals to see if I'm around. If you don't see me, chances are trying
to get hold of me will affect your chances negatively ), ask for my attention
on public channels. And only for this! 
&cDon't send me a tell, or I'll be cross.&D
 
If I respond, I'll probably snatch you away to my office and interview you.
If I like what I hear, I'll ask you to send me a mail.
If you get to send me a mail, this is what it should contain:
&RThree descriptions. One room, one mob, one object.&D
Don't mind the stats of the mob, or the object right now. Numbers are illegal!
Though if you have a really special idea concerning what the mob or object,
even the room, should do, put that in there too.
 
&c I will answer it. You will get an answer. In a mail.&D
Just don't expect it on the same day, or even in the same week.
&c It Will Come.&D
 
Thank you for reading this,
&R Khesekh&D

0 'AQUA BREATH'~
&RSyntax: &gcast 'aqua breath'
 
The aqua breath spell allows the caster to be able to breathe water and
so to avoid the possibility to drown or take damage from drowning. Some
magical items can be found across the realm that give this ability.
~

0 AQUABREATH~
&RSyntax:&g cast aquabreath <character>
 
This spell allows the character to breath in water areas and underwater.
Certain water sectors will require the use of aqua breath to prevent damage
from drowning.  If you are in an area and your movement suddenly begins to
drop and/or you begin losing hps <hitpoints>, you should either cast
aqua breath immediately or leave the area.&D
~

1 ARACHNOS~
Recommended level range: 5 - 20

A large amount of Haon Dor's treetops is covered in a sticky film:
the webs of a thousand spiders. The realm of Arachnos, as it is called
by Koenraad's adventurers, is a series of twisting, intricate webs
populated by arachnids and spiders. Some say that this fear-filled place
is named Arachnos after the name of its hideous ruler. The stories tell
of a dragon housed deep within the area, answering to the name of Yevaud.
~

0 ARCHER ARCHERS~
&gArchers are the folks that specialize in harming their
enemies from distance. Unlike spell casters, they use
physical weapons (bows and arrows) to achieve their goal.

1 AREAS~
&RSyntax:&g  areas
&RSyntax:&g  areas old
&RSyntax:&g  areas <low range> <hi range>
 
The 'areas' command displays an alphabetically sorted list of all areas
within the game, together with the author and suggested level range of
each area.  
 
The 'areas old' command displays an unsorted list of all areas (the old
style), as well as the author and suggested level range of each area.
 
You can specify a level range to see a list of all areas with suggested
ranges which encompass the argument.  This can be a little awkward as
each area has a low and a high suggested range.  Suffice to say that if
an area's level range matches even one level of the range you request,
it will be displayed.
 
Special thanks to Fireblade for design and coding of this restyled function.

800 AREA_DESC~
Room descriptions are to made how SwiftSword says they are.

800 ASH_RAT~
&g
Spreading fires throughout towns, fields, and forests, ash rats constitute a
deadly menace to any civilized society. These little nomadic horrors are natu-
rally drawn to large sources of flame; in fact, they get their nourishment from
heat in a way that not even the sages understand. These creatures are so hot
that they ignite any combustibles they touch.

An ash rat is a 2-foot-long rodent with orange eyes. It has the general shape
of a rat, and its fur is black, gray, or brown. Its oversized front teeth are
a dull yellow color. An ash rat's exact appearance is difficult for most onlook
-ers to discern because it exudes a perpetual cloud of sooty smoke that hides
it from view.

An ash rat normally flees from combat if possible. When cornered, it fights 
defensively, spitting fire at those who threaten it. Its heated body is painful
to the touch, which prevents prudent foes from closing.

&RSyntax:&g  cast 'astral walk'  <victim>  &RSyntax:&g  cast 'farsight'     <vi
tim>
&RSyntax:&g  cast 'portal'       <victim>  &RSyntax:&g  cast 'helical flow' <vi
tim>
 
These spells allow the very shape of space and time to be warped at the
caster's bidding:
 
'Astral walk' instantaneously moves the caster to the victim's location.
 
'Farsight' allows you to see the room in which the victim stands.
 
'Portal' forms a temporary tunnel through space to the victim.  A portal
will not succeed if a portal already exists in either the caster's or
the victim's location.  Type 'enter' or 'enter portal' to pass through.
 
'Helical Flow' morphs an Augurer into a coil of colour which instantly
travels to the victim's location.
 
These spells may fail if either the victim or the caster is in a location
which blocks their use, such as no-recall areas, no-summon areas, etc.

0 ATTACKER ATTACKERFLAG ATTACKERFLAGS~
&RAttacker &gflags are automatically given by the mud code to players
who engage in illegal attacks upon other players. These attacks can
initiated by using MURDER, casting an attack spell, or ordering
followers to attack a player. Deadlies attacking Deadlies do not
receive Attacker Flags. These flags are only given out in situations
that involve Peaceful players, i.e. Deadlies attacking Peacefuls,
(or vice versa), or Peacefuls attacking Peacefuls. You will be
tagged with an &RAttacker &gflag if:
 
  1. You attempt to MURDER another player, or they attempt to
MURDER you. (See &RHelp Murder &gand &RLaws Pkill &gfor more info
  on attacking other players).
 
  2. You order charmed mobiles or pets to attack a player, or you
are attacked by another players mobiles. (See &RHelp Charm &gor
&RHelp Pets &gfor more info)>
 
3. You are a &RDeadly &gplayer and attacked a fellow Clanmember.

&gKoenraad Guards, shopkeepers and special function mobs now respond
differently to illegal flags. You may find yourself barred from making
purchases, placed before Judge Kendra for a hearing, or sentenced to
jail. Should you acquire an &RAttacker &gor any other illegal activity
flag, see Judge Kendra in Townhall. Her Honour is located one west of
the Main Lobby (See &RHelp Townhall &gfor info).

1 AUC AUCTION~
.&RSyntax:&g auction (abbreviations: a , auc)
&RSyntax:&g auction <item name> <starting value>
&RSyntax:&g auction bid <value>
 
The auction command is used for performing auctions.  Simply typing auction
will display the current item being auctioned, if there is one.  
 
If nothing is being auctioned, auction <item name> <starting value> will 
begin an auction.  If no starting value is specified, it begins at 0 gold.
 
Auction bid <value> will place a bet for the item.
 
At the present, if the mud crashes in mid auction, you will lose both 
your bidded money and the item.  This will at some point be fixed.
 
You are able to see auction almost from the point of character creation,
however, you cannot USE auction unless you're level FIVE or higher. To remove
the auction channel from your screen, type CHANNEL -AUCTION.

1 AUCTION2~
&gAuction will also work with the following arguments:
 
au bid 20k      - bids 20000 coins
au bid 20k500   - bids 20500 coins (20,000 + 500)
au bid 20k5003  - bids 20500 coins, too (only checks first 3 chars after "k")
au bid 1m       - bids 1 million coins
 
On an existing bid of 10000:
au bid +10       - adds 10%, making the bet 11000.
au bid +         - adds 25% (the default if no number given), bet is 12500.
au bid x         - multiplies by 2, making the bet 20000.
au bid x5        - multiplies by 5, making the bet 50000.
 
It is illegal to auction <or barter, sell, trade> clan, order, or guild items.
Exception: Old clan equipment that was converted to be worn by both peaceful
           and deadly players.

1 BACKFIRE~
&gMagical items (pills, potions, staffs, wands) which cast offensive spells
have a chance of backfiring if the character using them is much lower in
level than the spell level on the item.
 
For example, a level 15 character trying to invoke a wand with level 50
fireball may injure themselves when the spell backfires.

1 BACKSTAB BS~
&RSyntax:&g  backstab <victim>
&RSyntax:&g  bs       <victim>
 
A backstab is a method of attack, used primarily by thieves but able
to be utilized by others in some circumstances, and which inflicts a
tremendous degree of damage on unsuspecting victims if successful.
 
An appropriate weapon type is required to backstab, and if your victim
is wounded or suspicious it may not be possible to surprise them.  The
most important factor in anyone's ability to backstab is to catch the
victim when they are unaware of your presence.

850 'BAN 50'~
Seeking to ban a site above level 1 should be an extremely rare situation. One
in which the actions of one or more key persons from a site are deemed to be
a detriment to the enjoyment of a large portion of the players in the game.
Such person(s) are generally deemed to be beyond rehabilitation at this time.
 
When seeking to ban a site, make use of the Grub command to both see the impact
of the ban, and to get a list of all character names from the site. You can use
this list to keep an eye out for these characters coming in from other sites,
as it's obvious these days that a site ban may not always cure the situation.
 
All site bans above level one should be set at level 50 or higher. It should be
a rare instance in which a site is banned at some in between level. Only in the
direst of instances would a site be banned above level 50, as this will affect
immortal level players as well.

850 'BAN DURATION'~
The standard set for ban durations are as follows:
 
Newbie Ban:          1) One week on first instance.
                     2) Two weeks for the second.
                     3) One month at newbie, or level 50 for third.
                     4) Permanent at newbie, or level 50 for 4th offense.
 
Bans for level 2-50: 1) One month for first instance.
                     2) Two months, or permanent for 2nd.
                     3) Permanent for 3rd offense.
 
All bans above level 50 should be permanent by their very nature.
 
&WReminder - Without documenting each time we ban a site, we will have no
           source of history on sites. Always remember to post a note
           detailing the reasons for the ban.&w

850 'BAN NEWBIE'~
Banning a site is a form of last resort, as it not only affects the offending
player or players, but will also affect every other player from that site.
Before seeking to ban a site, even for a temporary level 1 banning, make
sure you have exhausted all other options first. 
 
In the case of newbie bans, most such instances arise through the actions of 
one or more abusive players who log in a newbie and begin swearing, spamming, 
threatening, etc.. Many times this has developed from an immature player's 
frustrations over getting a name authed. If you find a player going through a 
series of silly names trying to auth them, make every effort to try and talk 
with them first. If this fails, use Fquit to discourage them. If you have 
Disconnect, use this instead, as it is less provoking than fquit (makes it 
appear as if they simply lost their conneection). If they continue their 
efforts, send them warnings to get their attention. Use freeze if you have it 
(or if someone else is on who can use it) to get their attention and make sure 
received the message. Then, and only then, once you've exhausted all avenues
at being civil, you can use ban in good conscience. You've given the player(s)
every chance to cease their actions and given them fair warning over the fact
that if they continue they risk getting banned.

centuries. The village is guarded by a few loyal citizens who remain
due to loyalty. The townspeople hide a secret passage that leads to the
keep. A large forest enshrouds the area and prevents it's notice to 
the outside world.

0 BASH~
&RSyntax:&g  bash
 
Bash can only be used once a fight has started.  It will inflict damage and
temporarily daze both yourself and your opponent for approximately two rounds
during which you cannot heal, flee or perform other extraneous combat actions
(i.e. you will be able to dodge/parry/attack but nothing else).  These same
consequences are inflicted on your opponent if it is a player character,
otherwise the skill only inflicts damage.
 
Note that bash has a drastically reduced chance of hitting if the basher is
not one of the primary combatants (i.e. is not tanking).
~

0 'BATTLE PLAN'~
&W'Battle Plan'&g

&RSyntax: &gc 'battle plan' <target>
 
This spell teaches the victim, whether it is yourself or
someone else, how to kill more proficiently by raising the 
victim's intelligence by two.  It increases the brain 
flow and ability to react in battle, in that it allows 
the victim to learn and adept at skills at a much faster 
rate. Casting this spell will also allow the target to be
in the state of mind where the target is more capable to 
place hits upon their opponent at more critical areas.

 
EXAMPLE: c 'battle plan' self (in this case you yourself 
are the victim), to cast it on yourself and, c 'battle 
plan' Kara (in this case <target> was replaced by Kara, 
so in this case Kara is the victim).

-1 BEGIN START~
&gWelcome to the exciting world of Kara's Storm! So you are new here?
Ok, I'll try to help you. Firstly, you may wonder what this game is
all about. You cannot officially win and see the 'game over' screen.
The game is technically about killing computer-controlled creatures
(also known as mobs or Non-Player Characters,NPCs). When you kill many 
mobs that are challenging enough for your character, you gain a level 
and your power increases [&BHELP LEVEL&g]. If you lose the fight to a 
mob, you die but your character does not get destroyed, merely damaged 
[&BHELP DEATH&g]. Player-controlled characters can fight each other 
only if they mutually want it and there is no big gap between their 
levels [&BHELP PK&g].
To learn how to control your character's actions, visit our mudschool. 
You can enter it by typing 'mudschool'. 
Don't forget that it is a social game and many people come here for 
communication. Please be civil and respect other players. Don't forget 
that there is a person behind every character.
And have fun!

0 CAST~
&RSyntax:&g cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.

&W Making a command more or less of a priority (hash) [lower/raise]
&g
&g What this does is make a command come in front of, or after another command.
&g To explain this a bit better, we will use two example commands, testcmd1 and
&g testcmd2.
&g Both of these commands are used, but when you type testcmd it runs testcmd1
&g and not testcmd2.
&g To do this we have to change the way commands are organized. If we want to 
&g make testcmd2 come in front of testcmd1 we would
&g      '&Rcedit &wtestcmd2 &Wraise
&g until we saw:
&Y      Moved testcmd2 above testcmd1.

Beneath Koenraad's cursed graveyard lies an ancient crypt afflicted
by the same curse. The undead run rampant in this horrible place,

1 'CHARGED BEACON'~
&RSyntax:&g  c 'charged beacon' <victim>
 
Charged beacon renders the victim susceptible to electricity attacks.
~

1 'CHARM' 'CHARM PERSON'~
&gThe charm spell, if successful, will place the victim (only mobs, attempts
to charm other player-characters may incur the wrath of the gods) under
your control for the duration of the spell.  While under your control
the creature is your servant, and may assist you in combat and other
more minor duties.  Use the 'order' command to give them orders.
 
Be warned, you are responsible for the actions of your charmed beast.  If
it should go awry and take the life of another player-character, you will
be charged as a murderer and will be hunted by several creatures around
the Realms.
 
Aggressive mobs will lose their aggressiveness while charmed, but will
immediately return to their violent ways when the spell wears off.  For
this reason, charmed aggressive mobs should not be taken into any area
lower from the one from which they came, and should *never* be taken
into Koenraad or the Academy.  Those found doing so will pay dearly.
 
As a matter of etiquette, charmed mobs should not be attacked.  You can
tell a mob is charmed if it is wandering "in a dazed, zombie-like state."
Be aware when taking your charmed mobs around other characters that any
area attack such as call lightning, gas breath or earthquake will hit
your creature and cause it to engage in combat.

precipitation, and wind. In addition, you may specify
neighboring areas who will affect changes in the current
areas weather. Therefore there are four fields to choose
from. Each field has a different range of values available.
 
Field name:           Values:
temp                  cold, cool, normal, warm, hot
precip                arid, dry, normal, damp, wet

neighbor              <area name>
 
Specifying an area name with neighbor which is already on
the list will remove it. Using climate without any arguments
will display the area's current setting. Note that this
command always refers to the area which you are currently in.

IDENTIFY to gauge the difficulty of the opponent.  You can LOOK <mob>
to get a look at its equipment and description, this will often help
indicate how hard a fight might be. You can CONSIDER <mob> for a one
on one comparison of the mobs hitpoints and level to your own.  You may
also CAST IDENTIFY <mob> to get more detailed information about the mob.
 
You may start a fight by using KILL, MURDER, or many spells and skills
available to players.  The easiest way to start a fight is to KILL <mob>.
Currently, you may also MURDER <mob>, but this causes the mob to yell out.
 
You may find yourself in trouble during a fight, and wish to leave, this
can be done by using FLEE or RECALL.  You can flee a fight by typing FLEE.
You may recall from a fight with the spell 'word of recall' or by reciting
a recall scroll.  You may also set it up to flee automatically once you go
below a certain number of hitpoints by using WIMPY.  To use your wimpy, type
WIMPY or WIMPY <number of hitpoints>.  Leaving a fight with wimpy, flee, and
recall WILL cost you a loss of experience, with recall causing the greatest
loss.

920 CONCEPT_EXPECTATIONS~
&gThis is an example of an area concept, as submitted to the staff.
 
The method I used in preliminary concept drafting for DemonKeep, my 
first MUD building project, is a method I learned from a good friend
of mine, who is an AD+D DM. It involves consideration of the aspects 
of the surrounding environment and previous experiences of the
playerbase. By examining some of the levels within DemonKeep's tier as
well as areas from other tiers, I was able to get a good feel of what
would be expected in an area of such specifications. From that point,
efforts towards creating the level itself were more focused.
 
DemonKeep is the holding place of a divine Commander, captured 
centuries ago during a nearly forgotten conflict. Shortly following 
his capture, a party of heroes ventured into the Keep through an 
overlooked entrance, only to be slain by the keep's varied perils. 
The divine Commander, an integral part in a master plan of evil, is 
forced to remain captive in a solitary cell until he surrenders his 
soul to the Overlord... or dies.
 
The aim of this area is to create an interesting and useful 
environment that will improve the player's proficiency as well as 
the player's level. Travelling through the keep, the player will 
learn of the perils of the Keep's defenses, and learn from the 
mistakes of those heroes who had fallen all those years ago.
 
DemonKeep is intended to be lethal, primarily, only if the player
disregards room descriptions and battle actions.
 
&gThis concept is continued in &cHELP CONCEPT_EXPECTATIONS2.&D
~

920 CONCEPT_EXPECTATIONS2~
&gThe continuation of an area concept, as submitted to the staff.
 
The player will experience challenging (but not particularly critical) 
lever puzzles, identify, avoid, and negotiate battle with aggressive,
assisting, and blocking mobs, both mobile and immobile, and learn 
techniques to combat an array of fighting styles, including tripping,
attack spells, poison, and tail attack.
 
In a test of their skills, players will face off against three 
Commanders of the Keep, each with a different fighting style and class
(Mage, Thief, Warrior). An intermediate test of player skill can be 
conducted against the ghosts of the ancient rescue party. This serves
two purposes: It provides evil players with a place to realign as well
as allows for challenges to continue as the player grows into and out
of the area's effective range.
 
Players become accustomed to the methods they will use against these 
higher class mobs by travelling through the Keep's tunnels and front 
gate area, where they will encounter lower class mobs utilizing 
tactics similar to their higher class counterparts.
 
Equipment will be distributed so as to provide the player with less 
than optimum modification for the area's level range, to promote some
venturing away from the area as more areas within the same range 
become available. Equipment (and mobs) will be divided into three
different level ranges, meaning the player can gain upgrades three 
times while within the Keep.

1 'CORAL DEPTHS'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 35

Following the Koenraad River eastward, many an adventurer has come upon
a vast area of glistening water and waves.  A casual swim is enjoyed here,
though one must be wary of fish and aggressive sharks.  It is beneath the
lapping waves where the wonders, and dangers, of the Coral Depths truly lurk.
The fabled Merfolk have founded a paradise under the sea, pushing back all
manners of danger from their wondrous village.  Some of the most wise and
intelligent scholars of Despair reside in Mer Village, teaching the cherished
young.  The Merfolk have one common enemy beneath the waves: a sea hag who
resides in the deepest corner of the dark coral tunnels.  Little is known
about this hag, yet it is suspected that she is preparing one day to destroy
the Merfolk completely...
~

0 CORRELATE~
&RSyntax:&g cast correlate <item>
 
This spell allows the caster a chance to remove the alignment of the item

&gCost is what an item is valued at. It sets what the selling value is.
It also sets what it can be bought at. It even determines if the object is

Value can be a number from 0 to 2 billion plus. If value is 2500000 or over,
the item is considered rare. Rare objects that a player has duplicates of will
be removed from their pfiles. Rare objects should be rare themselves so I don't
want alot of them arround.

1 'CR' 'CORPSE RETRIEVAL' 'CORPSE'~
&gBefore asking an immortal for a corpse retrieval, you &r-must-:
 
&g    - Attempt to get your corpse yourself, &rand
&g    - Use invis and hidden, this will get you past a lot of mobiles, &rand
&g    - Seek mortal assistance to retrieve your corpse.
    -&g If all else fails, wait at least 20 minutes after death to ask for an
      Immortal corpse retrieval.&w
&g
**  "I need to leave now!" is not grounds for an early Immortal CR.
**  Corpses last approximately 40 - 60 minutes after the time of death.
**  Corpse decay will happen even while you are linkdead or after you quit.
**  Characters listed under 'who deadly' are not eligible for Immortal CR.
**  Corpses _will_ save over crashes and reboots, but will continue to decay
    once the Realms comes back online.  Log back on quickly to get corpse.

The cost for CRs is usually one item from your corpse.  An Immortal may
choose to charge MORE or LESS. 
 
&RAn Immortal corpse retrieval is not a right, but a privilege. &gPestering
or being demanding is cause for the Immortal to deny your request.  An
Immortal may refuse to do any CR at their discretion.  You may not barter
which items an Immortal can take from your corpse as the charge, the
Immortal's decision is final.

1000 CR'S~

For all you new players and a few old players there is a new game in town.
Read the following and learn.
 
RECALL, then go 1N, 1E. This takes you to the &RMorgue and the UnderTaker.&g

&PAn undertaker stands here waiting to help you.&g
 
Carl, the undertaker turns towards you.
&RCarl says to you &wPlease come in, type corpse for help.

&GPlayer types Corpse.&w
 
Carl will tell you the following.
&RCarl says to you &wOoo Yesss ... I can helpss you.
&RCarl says to you &wIt will cost you 20 katyr per your level....

Example: A level 20 player will pay 20 Katyr per level. Thats 20 TIMES 20.
That makes it 400 Katyr to have his corpse retrived. Cheap compared to all
the time he would spend replacing all of his lost gear.

We use this to keep a clean copy of the code. Below is a step by step
proceedure that you should use when working with the code.
 
1. Logon - user &Pmud&g, password &Rlongsword&g
&g2. cd /home/mud/coders/<first three letters of imm name>
3. &Ycvs update&g
4. cd src
5. Work on the file(s) you want to edit.
6. &Ycvs update&g
7. &Wcvs commit -m "<message>"&g 
   - Replace <message> with a short desc of what you did
8. type s - I aliased cd /home/nicole/dist/src to the letter s
9. &Ycvs update&g
10. make clean
11. warmboot
 
The above is the correct procedure to use CVS while coding here on
Kara's Storm. If you don't use this, your changes could be lost and
I will not try to recover them.

0 DAMAGE~
&gWhen one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown
in the verb used in the damage message.  Damage messages vary depending
on weapon type, or what is inflicting the damage.  Escalating damage is
indicated by the use of _ _ around the messages, regardless of weapon
type.  Messages in all caps indicate even higher degrees of damage,
while those surrounded by * * indicate the highest levels.
 
The message shown will reflect the actual damage you are inflicting on
(or receiving from) your opponent, and not a specific fixed amount.

0 DEADLYCLANS~
&gClans are a society within Realms composed of a group of players which
have joined together under a common cause.  If you a member of a 
clan you have the ability to pkill other deadly players outside of your
own clan.  Depending on the clan in which you join, you may be asked 
to follow set of rules dictated by the clan's leaders. 

For more information on a current deadly clan type HELP <clanname>
 
&RNOTE: &gNon-deadly and deadly players may join a deadly clan, however
when the character is outcasted it remains deadly.
~

1 DEADLYHQ~
Peacefuls are not permitted EVER to enter deadly headquarters.
~

840 DEAF~
&RSyntax : &gdeaf

The deaf command allows a character to wonder around without being 
able to hear anything.  

Characters who are deaf no longer receive communications from other
characters, directly (tell, reply) or indirectly (say, chat etc.). 
The who command will show which characters are deaf, this information
will also be on your character's score sheet.&D
~

0 DEATH~
&g
When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the Altar to Nicole in
Koenraad (or your clan's temple).  Your corpse is left behind where you
were killed, together with all of your equipment.  Your katyr stays with
you (the gods want you to have your katyr).
 
Any spells which were affecting you are cancelled by death, and you lose
experience points as well.  Following/groups are not affected by death.
 
Corpses decay after time.  When this happens the objects inside a corpse
will decay with it.  Player corpses last roughly 30 minutes of real time.
Only the player who died or someone in their group can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.  The only exceptions are for deadly characters,
who can loot each other's corpses at will.
 
If you have chosen a deity and have gained enough favor, you may be able
to supplicate to your god for your corpse.  Also see 'help supplicate',
'help deities', 'help favor' for more information on deities.
 
&RSee also : &ghelp cr, help mortuary&g
~

1 DEATHTRAP DT~
A "death trap" refers to the scenario where one steps into a room and is
immediately awakened from death with no equipment or corpse. A corpse
recovery is not an option in this case as there is no corpse to retrieve.
 
There are also pseudo death traps that may appear to be a dt, but leave a 
corpse or transfer a corpse to another area. This is not a true dt. 
 
It is often advisable to look before one leaps and heed room descriptions.
DT's do not warrant a reimbursement, they are part of the game. Katyr,
glory and favor are not affected by a death trap.

0 DEFENSIVE~
&RSyntax:&g style defensive
 
This style emphasizes the deflecting of blows from an enemy. It is similar
to the evasive style, except that it focuses on holding ground instead of
dodging. An effective fighter will take less damage from an enemy, but not
as much as one using evasive tactics. A fighter will also do less damage to
enemies, but slightly greater than those who simply evade.

0 DEMONS~
&g
In the countless, nearly infinite realms of the Abyss, demons grow numerous
and varied. Through all embrace the path of evil, the tanar'ri stand as supreme
villains within the Abyssal hierarchy of iniquity. These creatures are const-
antly in conflict with every force of good in the universe, as well as with the
lawful evil devils and baatezu of the Nine Hells.
 
The abyssal maw, abyssal skulker, and abyssal ravager are vivious but servile
demons that can be found in the service of more powerful demons, or of evil 
mortals who treat with such beings. All three creatures speak Abyssal and 
Common, though abyssal maws and abyssal ravagers speak none too clearly, thanks
to their low intelligence and toothy maws.
 
The jovoc, palrethee, jarilith, and kelvezu appear wherever their demonic 
masters see fit to make use of them, be it the hidden reaches of their personal
domains or out among mortals on the Material Plane. The zovvut, though not a
tanar'ri itself, serves under and alongside those creatures. All five of these
demons speak Abyssal, Celestial, and Draconic.

1 DEX DEXTERITY~
&gDexterity (DEX in your 'score') represents your character's agility, and
it affects (among other things):
 
 - the maximum number of items you can carry at once in your inventory;
   with each additional point of dex you can carry additional items.
 
 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.
 
 - the number of new moves you receive each time you level, as well as the
   number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).
 
 - success chances with bash, stun and gouge, and helps determine whether a
   thief will be able to poison a weapon or tumble effectively.
 
Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.
 
Dexterity is the prime attribute of thieves and vampires.

1 DISARM~
&RSyntax:&g  disarm
 
Disarm is an auxiliary fighting command to attempt to disarm your opponent.
Several things affect your ability to disarm or resist a disarm attempt
successfully, including your weapon and your stats compared to the weapon
and stats of your opponent.
 
You can only attempt to disarm your primary opponent, meaning you will be
unable to try to disarm a second or third attacker until you have disposed
of the first.

1 DISCLAIMER~
&gBy continuing to play this MUD you are &Racknowledging that&g:
(1)  you are willing to abide by the decisions of the Immortals concerning
     all issues involved in the game, and
(2)  conversation and situations may arise during the course of play that 
     may not be suitable for young children.

By these acknowledgments you hereby save and except this MUD and it's
Administrators from any and all liability that may arise during gameplay.
~

1 DISCLOSURE~
&RSyntax: &gc 'disclosure'
 
This spell will reveal any sneaking or hiding players in the area. However,
it will also reveal the caster.
~

1 DISMISS~
&RSyntax:&g dismiss <target>

~

0 'DISPEL EVIL'~
&RSyntax:&g cast 'dispel evil' <victim>
 
This spell invokes the wrath of the gods upon an evil victim.  If you do
not specify a target, the spell's effect will strike you instead of a
secondary target.
~

0 'DISPEL MAGIC'~
&RSyntax:&g  cast 'dispel magic' <character>
 
This spell dispels magical affects on the victim.  It may be used as an
offensive spell to remove an enemy's magical advantages, or as a benign
spell to completely remove your own magical affects.
 
If you are not a mage, you must be affected by the 'detect magic' to be
able to use this spell.  Though mages do not necessarily need to use it,
being under the affects of 'detect magic' will reveal more information
unavailable otherwise or to other classes.
 
'Dispel magic' can be used by players and mobiles alike against either
players or mobiles.  It cannot remove affects from equipment, your race
or your deity; some other affects are immune to this spell as well.
 
When a caster successfully casts 'dispel magic' on themself they will
remove all of their dispellable magical affects.  If a mage successfully
dispels a victim, the number of affects stripped will depend on their
success and intelligence.  Otherwise a successful cast of 'dispel magic'
on a victim will result in the removal of a single affect each time
(victims will notice when and what affects are stripped).
 
WARNING:  this is an offensive spell, and its use on anyone other than
yourself will be treated as an attack on your target.

be enveloped in a weird energy field that momentarily alters the plane
which the victim inhabits.  The spell was an early attempt by the Dark

the victim exits and reenters his current plane of existence.

This command toggles your personal dnd flag.
This command effectively secludes immortals from those of lower level. 
Each immortal has a personal dnd flag associated with their pfile. In
addition, each room can have a dnd flag associated with the room.
 
When your personal dnd flag is set, lower level imms can't 'at', 'goto',
'trans', sight you on 'where' or 'where (name). This does not affect LD 
immortals, they can still be transferred, even with the DND flag on. To 
see the flag's status, 'mstat self', it will be listed under 'pcflags'.
Syntax for room flag: redit flags DND
 
The DND room flag effectively blocks any 'at', and 'goto' commands
either to the room, or to a mob/object in the room. NOTE: It is only
in effect if:
a) there is an immortal in the room with their DND flag on.
b) the immortal attempting the commands is of lower level than the
   immortal with the activated DND flag in the room.

0 DRAGON~
&g
Dragons are legendary and mystical reptilian creatures that, in time, 
can become some of the most powerful creatures in the realm. A full grown
dragon stands taller than most races, is covered with protective scales,
has large leathery wings, a powerful tail, long sharp claws, and the ability 
to utilize a distinctive breath weapon against their opponents. Dragons are 
both physically powerful and adept at magic. They tend to excel at every
endeavor, but while they may be strong, they really progress in power 
quite slowly.

~

1 'DRAGON CULT'~
&gRecommended level range: 5 - 25

1 'DRAGON TOWER'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 30

As the ages pass, the Order of Dragonslayer continues its eternal
struggle against the dragons of Despair. The weaker members of the

draconians, a breed of half-dragon humanoids, were led by their king
into the Shadow Grove. Within this shadowy land, they erected a towering
structure with the aid many powerful dragons of all colors. The most powerful
of these, the Dragon Queen Tiamat, was later magically banished to the Dragon
Tower by the most powerful Dragonslayer mages.

1 'DROW CITY'~
Recommended level ranges: 15 - 25

Early in Despair's history the elves where all one race, on the side of
good. But Laschte, in his infinite insanity enticed a group of elves
from the village of Misinkii, turning them on the path of darkness and
destruction. He warped them to be haters of light, cruel and warlike,
even upon each other. He then sent one of his children, a demi-goddess
of chaos and arachnids to watch over them and prepare them as fodder
in his war with Brontrel. Llolth took these dark elves into her evil web
of deception and had them build a city beneath the dwarven forest. Four
houses arose admidst the strife and chaos between the drow as they have
now are called. Llolth's priestesses rule over the city preparing them
for the one day they will have vengeance on the surface elves. Lately,
rumors have sprung up about an alliance between Drow City and Shadowport..

the happy community of Elves which roam the forests today, but have long
since moved under the ground, building vast subterranean cities and 
complex networks of caves. Drow have black skin and white hair, and are
moderately weaker and have a more slight constitution than average humans.
Still, like all Elves, they have a slightly higher dexterity than men.
Members of this race specialize in spell casting, and have thus developed
a very high intelligence. Being creatures of darkness the Drow tend to fight
more proficiently in the darkness, and have innate infravision with which to
discern objects and living things in the absence of light.

2 DROW_WARRIOR~
&g
Deep in the darkness, the gloom
of the dungeon enveloped the
young drow warrior.
 
Pacing back and forth as far as
the length of chain would allow
him. He scarcely felt the cold,
his one thought was escape.
 
Pulling the warm piawfwi of
deep blue evermore tightly
around him, he considered his
plight.
 
No one could hear....
No one could see....
No one could help....
 
The chain was his enemy now.
Each link, each bolt, each screw,
keeping him from his freedom.
He was alone.... He could do
nothing.... for he slept.
 
The silent erie dungeon remained
shrouded in silence,
waiting as....
 
As he finally spoke his last
word's. "Dream of me,"
For I am no more. "Remember me."
For I shall join the *Angels*.

0 DRUID DRUIDS~
&g
The druid is a lover and protector of the natural land. Be it the forests
full of centaurs and deer, the streams full of fish, or the bug-infested
swamps, a druid always strives to protect and preserve nature.  Wielding
mighty spells from the gods themselves, druids strive hard at their work.
 
Strong in wisdom, with a body trained to near perfection by their rugged
lifestyle, a druid has many disciplines upon which to draw.  From powerful
spells of healing which can bring the near dead back to full vigor, to the
ability to mystically create water and food, to the awesome power of nature
which they command in battle via spells able to quake the land and split
the sky, druids demonstrate that mastery of magic is not just a hobby, but
a way of life for them.  Able to face many warriors on almost even footing,
and able to shield themselves nearly as well as some mages, druids are
truly a gifted class.

Dwarves are relatively short (in Human terms), stocky and 
powerfully-built creatures. Long-lived and extremely sturdy, they are 
known equally as well for their hardiness as for their cantankerous 
personalities. Their thick, stout frames lend them poor dexterity, but
high strength and stamina. This race has produced some of the most
renowned fighters. Dwarves possess the inherent ability to see in the 
dark with infravision.

0 EARTHQUAKE~
&RSyntax:&g cast 'earthquake'

This spell inflicts damage on every enemy character in the room.
Beware that other characters who are not yet fighting may attack
you as a result!
 
Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.

0 EAT DRINK~
&RSyntax:&g  drink <object>                  (drink liquid from a drink contain
r)
&RSyntax:&g  eat   <object>                  (eat food or a magical pill)
         eat   <object> <container>      (eat directly from a container)
 
Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or mana back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.

1 EATING DRINKING HUNGER THIRST~
&gEating and drinking are very important...
 
If you let yourself starve or dehydrate, your mental state will be affected,
and you may have problems performing even the simplest of tasks.
 
Typing 'score' will give you an indication of your current mental state.
('oldscore' will also show this information)
 
Sitting, resting and sleeping will increasingly contribute to better your
mental state (if done while not starving/dehydrating).
 
Being hurt badly in battle ("That really did HURT", and "You wish that your
wounds would stop BLEEDING so much!") as well as poisoning will also have a
rapid negative affect on your mental state.

ECHO sends a message to all players in the game, without any prefix indicating
who sent it.  If 'echo imm <message>' is used, only level 51+ characters will 
see the message. If 'echo pc <message>' is used, only player characters will 
see the message. Echos should always adhere to the guidelines laid out in the 
Realm of Order (vnum 1214).
 
ECHO done in color should avoid the use of red and dark red unless it is a 
Urgent message containing important information related to the game.

RECHO sends a message to all players in your room, without any prefix
indicating who sent it.

800 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.

0 ELDERDRAGON~
.
&gElderdragons are legendary and mystical  reptilian creatures that, in 
time, can become some of the most powerful creatures in the realm. A 
full grown elderdragon stands taller than any other race, is covered with 
protective scales, has large leathery wings, a powerful tail, long sharp 
claws, and the ability to utilize a distinctive breath weapon against their 
opponents. Elderdragons are both physically powerful and adept at magic.
They tend to excel at every endevor, but while they may be strong, they 
really progress in power quite slowly.

1 'ELEMENTAL CANYON'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 30

The immense elemental canyon lies on the southern border of the dark
dwarven forest. Once, long ago, the canyon was a flat portion of the
forest, yet the workings of a powerful elder mage destroyed the
landscape surrounding his, or her, home. As a backlash from his
wielding of elemental magics, strange entities formed of the very
elements were formed. These magical beings staked out land in the
newly created canyon and now wage a war amonst each other. Little
else is known about these eerie beings and their war, for none have
ever managed to communicate with the inhabitants of the canyon.

0 ELF ELVES~

Tall, slender creatures with an affinity for the woods and nature, Elves
are distant cousins to the Pixies and share the intelligence and 
dexterity of that winged race to a lesser degree. With a lighter frame 
than Humans, what they lack in strength and stamina is made up for with 
their superior agility - both in thought and movement. Elves are capable 
in all classes, though they function poorest in the role of pure fighter. 
Most Elves will prefer to stay close to nature, and many become druids.

is damaged more than five times it will be destroyed or scraped.
 
If you wish to preserve the equipment, you must repair it by taking it to
the town blacksmith. (NOTE:  Not all equipment is repairable)  You may also
notice that while fighting a creature which attacks you with acid breath or
another acid attack, your equipment gets "etched and pitted."  When this

0 ETI ETIQ ETIQUETTE BEHAVIOR~
&g
During your stay here on Kara's Storm, you will find yourself
interacting with objects, mobs, players and staff just as you would in
your real life. The following are things that you can do, but please
use your best judgement when doing so, and take responsibility for
your own actions.
 
It is inappropriate to perform the following:
 
01.  Kill a mob that someone else is fighting. Apologize if you do so
     on accident to prevent upsetting the other player.
02.  Follow a player without their permission or that doesn't want you
     to follow them.
03.  Cycle through Mudschool over and over after you have completed
     the tutorial. There may be other low-level players that wish to equip
     themselves before taking on the storm.
04.  Litter the Realm with items you do not want. Either donate it
     (HELP DONATE), sacrifice it (HELP SACRIFICE) or junk it if you own it
     (HELP JUNK).
05.  Not respond when addressed. We understand that your attention may
     be elsewhere, but make the best attempt to respond.
06.  Not show respect for the IMMs, ANGELS or other players on Kara's
     Storm.
07.  Harrass, flame, ridicule, belittle, or insult others publicly via
     notes, channels, or in person (player-player interaction).
08.  Trick players into going into a dangerous area or humilitating
     themselves.
09.  Move high-level mobs into beginner areas and/or leaving mobs in
     places other than where you found them.

     Thank you.
 
None of this is policy, rather courtesy, and this list may change at
any time. So be kind to your fellow player and enjoy what Kara's Storm
has to offer. You may or may not be warned of your actions, but
continually acting inappropiately will lead to behavioral intervention
with one of our friendly Immortals.

800 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
Currently there can only be one exit in a certain direction.
The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~

0 EXITS~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
&G
&RSyntax:&g  level
 
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  Type LEVEL to see
how many experience points you'll need for the next few levels.
 
You gain experience by:
    inflicting damage upon an opponent
    being part of a group that kills an opponent
    succeeding while learning a skill or a spell through real world usage
 
You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of some spells (energy drain, etc.)
    dying
 
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:  how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment and some random variation.
 
Your last 50 kills are recorded.  Each time you kill a creature that has
been one of your last 50 kills you will receive less and less exp for it.
The creature will also learn from its experience with you over time; if
its intelligence is higher than your own it will begin to gain an
advantage over you in combat.

0 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL PORTAL' 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL'~
&RSyntax: &gc 'extradimensional portal'
 
The Great Wizard Thanatos, after creating his fabled WarMagicks,
found himself snubbed and abused in and about The Realms for his
researches.  Much time would pass before mages and other classes
alike would learn the true power of these spells.
 
In the interim, disguised as an assassin, Thanatos became interested
in a more minor problem: that of carrying off the loot he gained
from all those he slew with Quantum Spike.  Realising that such a
formula would be easily grasped by his class, he thought to extend
it freely.
 
As a final touch to the spell, he thought he would spite those of
other classes by inbuing into these containers a quality which made
them unobtainable by the other classes.

800 FREEZE~
&RSyntax:&g FREEZE <player>

FREEZE will restrict the target player from all movements and commands.
This can be used to tell off or punish a player.

Note: Typing FREEZE again will unfreeze the player.
~

1 FRENZY~
&RSyntax:&g cast frenzy <character>
 
This spell summons blind rage upon its target.  Frenzied characters
receive more power to augment into their combat attacks; the
spell, however, adds more flaws to their defense. &D
~

800 FSHOW~
-----------------------------------------------------------
 
     &RSYNTAX:&G fshow <moblog | plevel>
 
DESCRIPTION: The FSHOW command when used with the MOBLOG
             variable, displays the current log of MPLOG. When
             FSHOW is used with the PLEVEL variable, it will
             display the current log of all character levels
             that have occurred since the last reboot.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------
~

0 FURNITURE~
&RSyntax:&g (sit/sleep/rest/stand) (object)
 
It is now possible to sit/stand/sleep/rest on/in/at properly
created pieces of furniture.  All you have to do is find a piece
of furniture that is working properly and just type 'sit chair'
if it was a chair.  If you can sit on it, it will allow you
to either sit on/in/at it.
~

800 FURNITUREVALUES~
.
It is now possible to sit/sleep/rest/stand on furniture.
Here is how all of this works.
 
value2 - sit/sleep/rest/stand on furniture (more below)
 
As for value2, it uses bitvictors, and here are their numbers
 
SIT ON -    1        SIT IN -    2        SIT AT -    4
STAND ON -  8        STAND IN -  16       STAND AT -  32
SLEEP ON -  64       SLEEP IN -  128      SLEEP AT -  256
REST ON -   512      REST IN -   1024     REST AT -   2048
 
Furniture is set using the v2 setting and through adding the
values to make it work.  Say you want SIT ON and STAND IN, you
would add 1 and 16 and get 17.
 
A quick note, you can only be on in at an object.  If you
set all 3 of them to lets say Sit, when type type sit
object, they will sit at the object.  So only select
one.

1 GALAXY~
Recommended level range: 20 - 30

The galaxy is a strange magical fantasy; a dream received upon peering
into a crystal ball. Those who have adventured in and returned from this
strange realm  tell of floating through the stars, fighting blazing
comets and mighty constellations.
~

1 'GALVANIC WHIP'~
&RSyntax: &gc 'galvanic whip'

a highly charged rope of air that automatically lashes out at his

~

0 GARB~
&RSyntax:&g garb
 
This command shows the possible equipment wear locations that are available
in the realm.&D
~

2 GATE~
&RSyntax:&g cast gate

This spell gates in a guardian vampire.  Player characters don't have much use
for it, but high demons, and guardian vampires themselves, like it a lot.
~

800 GFIGHTING~
-----------------------------------------------------------
 
     &RSYNTAX:&G gfighting
             gfighting <low> <high>
             gfighting <low> <high> mobs
 
DESCRIPTION: The GFIGHTING command does a global search 
             for the fighting targets specified, where 
             <low> <high> indicates the target's level.
 
    EXAMPLE: gfighting 1 5 would display a list of PCs 
             levels one through five that are fighting, 
             who they are fighting and their level, what 
             vnum/room name they are fighting in, and the 
             name of the area they are fighting in. By 
             adding the 'mobs' variable, the command 
             would display the same information for mobs 
             of the levels specified.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------
~

0 GHOUL~
&gGhouls are humaniod looking creatures that have bulging redish
eyes and large mouths lined with rows of tiny razor-sharp teeth. 
Their skin is a thick hide usually of a darker color. They are often 
seen eating the dead even other fallen Ghouls and can be often 
found around crypts and cemeteries.
~

0 GITH~
&g
The Gith are a race descended from humans. Once long ago, they were a 
peaceful civilization of humans that were captured by mind flayers and
tormented for centuries. Eventually, a savior named Gith led them to 
freedom, yet their bodies had been flayed by the mental powers of the 
Illithids. The Gith found themselves, stronger, quicker, luckier and 
smarter than average humans, yet they had lost much of their faith, 
wisdom, stamina and charisma.
&g
~

1 GLANCE~
&RSyntax:&g  glance
&RSyntax:&g  glance <victim>
 
Glance alone shows you only the contents of the room you are in,
eliminating the description.  Glance <victim> shows only the health
condition, eliminating their description and equipment from your
screen.
 
Glance may be abbreviated as 'gl'.
~

0 GLORY~
&g
Glory is a measure of how valiant you are, and is accumulated by taking part
in quests (mostly) and possibly in a few other ways in the near to distant
future.  It appears on your score screen as:
 
                    Glory: 264(430)
 
  The number in parentheses is the total lifetime glory attained by your
character, and the other number is your current glory.
 
   Unlike Quest Points of old, Glory will not only go to the "winner" of the
quest, but will be awarded on a basis of participation.  For example, the big
prize might not only go to the person who killed the monster,  but also to
the person who solved the riddle first, etc.  Players who took part in the
quest and helped a notable amount will also receive lesser amounts of Glory.
 
   Glory cannot be traded or transferred between characters.  This would be
like Odysseus passing all the reknown for his deeds off onto someone else.

~

800 GLORYSET~
&RSyntax: &ggloryset <character> <amount>
 
This immortal command adds the &Pamount&g of &Yglory&g points to the
&Pcharacter's&g current glory and is used as a form of reward.

&RSyntax:&g Glorytrade <character> <amount>

This immortal command takes the &Pamount&g of &Yglory&g points to be
traded in on a prize of the &Pcharacter's&g choice.

-1 GNOME GNOMES~
&g
Gnomes are a quirky demi-human race. Though not the mightiest of races,
they are well versed in their studies of knowledge, magic and religions.
Additionally, due to their familiarity with such lore, they tend to be 
more resistant to magic. They can, though, suffer tremendously from 
physical attacks. Gnomes usually focus in the magical or clerical arts,
though a few rogues have ventured into the arts of thieving (albeit 
often not very well.) Gnomes are a short, stocky race, similar to their
dwarven cousins. Most often prefer an evening at home with a magical
tome, a loaf of pipe weed bread and a cup of ale over venturing out
to battle.
&g
~

0 GOBLIN~
&g
This is a sub-human race of the world. Small, like halflings, hairless and 
dark of coloration. They are weak, unintelligent, and spineless. With a high 
regard for self preservation, a goblin will throw his best friend in the path 
of an enemy. It is just as well that the only thing they're good at is 
running.
&g
~

800 GOTO REGOTO~
&RSyntax:&g &Ggoto <location>
or
&RSyntax:&g goto <vnum1> <vnum2>

GOTO takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

If the location is a vnum, and it does not already exist, and it is within
your room vnum range; it shall be created for your to edit further with
REDIT.

You may not GOTO a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present.

You may also "GOTO pk" to go to the site of the most recent illegal pkill.

REGOTO will take you to the last place that you used goto to go to.

You may also specify two vnums and it will goto between both of them, thus
filling up all the vnums, making this a useful tool for builders.
&RExample: &Ggoto 25000 25199

~

1 GOUGE~
&RSyntax:&g  gouge
 
This attack can only be used in combat, and will strike at the eyes of
your opponent, causing damage and temporary blindness.
 
Note that gouge has a reduced chance of hitting if the gouger is not
one of the primary combatants (i.e. is not tanking).
 
See also BLIND, BLINDED
~

1 GRASP 'GRASP SUSPIRIA'~
&RSyntax:&g  grasp
 
The suspiric grasp is the vampire's most lethal attack, allowing it to
drain the life of its opponent in larger quantities than nearly any
other skill or spell in the Realms.  The more intelligent is the
vampire, the more effectively it will perform this loathsome act.  Be
aware that the magical nature of this attack causes it to be affected
by the victim's saves.
 
~

2 GRATZ~
&RSyntax: &ggratz <player name>
 
'Gratz' is a channel. When players level, all those who choose to, are
notified of that players level gain. You may use the Gratz channel to
congratulate those you wish to.

1 GRAVEYARD~
Recommended level range: 5 - 10

Koenraad's graveyard was once a peaceful burial ground, visited by
grieving citizens and tended by gentle priests. However, a powerful
curse was cast upon this land by an unknown mage. Within days, the
soft brown earth had turned black and sooty. A year later, the dead
began to claw their way out of the earth, roaming the graveyard in
search of flesh. Though many have tried to lift the curse on this
small plot of land, none of these attempts have succeeded. Some sages
believe that an elder God of evil protects the curse of the graveyard.
~

1 'GREAT EASTERN DESERT'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 20
 
The Great Eastern Desert lies far to the east of Koenraad, just south
of the majestic New Thalos. It is a barren wasteland, inhabitated only
by nomads and desert wildlife. Those who have found shelter from the
sweltering sun often describe an encounter with a great brass dragon who
resides in a chamber which prevents the usage of magic...

&RSyntax:&g  c grounding
 
Grounding renders the victim resistant to electricity attacks.
This spell may not be used on a target.
~

1 GROUP GROUPING~
&RSyntax:&g  group <character>, group all, group, group disband
 
'Group <character>' adds someone who is following you into your group, making
them a group member.  Group members share experience from kills, and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will
automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, 'group <character>' again to
remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group does not
stop them from following you, however.  A character can also leave a group
by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they will both leave your
group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
'Group all' groups all eligible players following you in the room.
 
'Group disband' allows the leader to disband his group (members will stop
following and are ungrouped).
 
You may group only characters within eight levels of your own.  See section
10 of your Adventurer's Guide for more information on groups and grouping.

Here are some sample uses of GRUB:
 
grub 20 pkill=y class=5      Display 20 Druid pkillers
grub 20 level=2 last<=970120 Display 20 L2 players absent since 970120
grub 20 level>=20 level<=30  Display 20 players levels 20 thru 30
grub  0 level=2              Count the number of level 2 players
grub 20 level>50 gold>100000 Display 20 imms with more than 100k gold
grub 50 damroll>100 sex=2    Display 50 females with damroll>150
grub  0 class=5 damroll>150  Count the number of druids with damroll>100
grub 20 site<>123.456.789    Display 20 players from site 123.456.789
grub 10 class=0 race=2       Display 10 dwarven mages
grub  1 name=Joe             Display Joe's info
grub 20 room=7070 class=0    Display 20 mages who logged off in 7070
grub  0 class!=2 class!=3 class!=4   Count the number of mana users
 
You always need to specify the number of lines you want displayed. The
reason for that is that we don't want to ask for a list and then get
surprised to find that it's 15,000 lines long. You can get a count
of the players that match your criteria by requesting zero lines.
 
GRUB will tell you how many lines there are in the list no matter how
many you ask to display. So if there are 15,000 players that meet your
criteria and you ask for the first ten, GRUB will tell you there are
15,000 in total but will only show you the first ten.

~

800 'GRUB EXAMPLES'~
Here are some examples illustrating common usages:
 
Example:
 
grub 20 or hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
Suppose you want to search for "suspicious players". Suppose you want
to see players who have more than 200 million gold or whose damroll
exceeds 150 or whose hitroll exceeds 150 you can do that as follows:
 
Normally GRUB lists players who satisfy all the conditions you specify.
But it can also be used like this to list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
The operand "or" ensures GRUB will list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
If you had specified:
 
grub 20 hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
That would show you players whose hitroll exceeds 150 and whose damroll
exceeds 150 and whose gold exceeds 200 million. It would be a much
smaller list and you would miss many suspicous players.
 
Example:
 
grub 20 name>ska name<skb room>=21000 room<=21499
 
Suppose someone complains that a player with a name like "Skathamaga"
picked up some of their eq and promptly quit the game. The player isn't
sure of the exact name of the thief but is sure it starts with "Ska".
The thief quit the game somewhere in New Koenraad (vnums 21000-21499).
 
This example will show you players whose name starts with "Ska" and who
last quit the mud somewhere in New Koenraad.

         10 Gith&w
&GYou can have more than one conditional expression in a Grub search. "And" is
assumed unless "or" is placed before the arguements. ie:
&W    Grub 10    class=3 sex=2    (Gives back a list of 10 female warriors)
    Grub 10 or class=3 sex=2    (Gives back a list of 10 characters that
                                 are either female, or warriors).
You must always specify how many lines the Grub will produce. This prevents
your getting a list 15000+ lines long.

0 GUILD GUILDS~
&gGuilds are special organizations for each class within the realms. Belonging
to a Guild has many advantages, such as gaining new knowledge of your class,
making new friends in the Realms, exciting quests, the great feeling of 
helping other players, and many other aspects of Guild life make being in a
Guild a memorable experience.  Each Guild has its own separate headquarter
with a healer, a practice room, a Guild store, and many other rooms that makes
each Guild unique unto itself.
 
Membership in a Guild is not something that is easily obtained, and you must
be a law-abiding player.  Deadly players are not allowed to join Guilds.
There are rules within each Guild, and along with these rules, you must
follow the rules of this MUD.
 
To gain entry into a Guild, you should speak with a leader of the Guild.  The
leaders are those people who have the title <Leader>, <First> and <Second>.
To find out who is on from a Guild, type "who 'Guild of *****'.  For example,
if you are a Druid, and you wish to find out who is on from the Guild of 
Druids, type "who 'Guild of Druids'", and you will be given a list of players
that belong to the Guild.
 
Type &Rhelp 'guild rules' &gfor a list of rules about Guild equiment and items.

0 'GUILD RULES'~
.
&RIt is illegal to sell, trade, auction or give away Guild items. &gIncluding
potions, pills, scrolls, equipment and containers.  Anything you can buy in
a Guild house is off limits for selling.  If you are found to be trading in
these illegal items, you stand the chance of not only being outcast from your
Guild, but your Guild may lose the ability to sell those items.
 
Please do not engage in buying such items either, as the Immortals reserve
the right to remove Guild items from ANY person not belonging to that Guild.
Just because you can buy it on the "black market" does not mean the Immortals
will allow you to keep it.
 
If you are in doubt whether an item is a Guild item, you are free to ask an
Immortal. Most Guild items have the name "guild" on it when you use identify.
 
There are rules that are specific to Guilds.  If you are not sure if something
is legal or illegal within your Guild, please contact a leader.

&RSyntax: &gcast 'hades armor' <character>
 
Hades armor was the form of holy protection of the

became known to everyone.
Using this enchantment envelopes the character with
the cloak which helps his/her armor absorb the blows
of the enemies.&D

0 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALFELVES~
&g
These beautiful creatures are the result of the mixing of human and Elvin
blood. Though the resulting Half-Elf is not as intelligent as the 
pure-blooded Elf, nor as hardy as the full-blooded Human, this mix serves 
quite well in a variety of classes which require the standards of both 
mental and physical prowess. Their beautiful almond eyes enable them to 
discern objects in the darkness.
&g
~

0 HALF-OGRE HALFOGRE~
&gThe Half-Ogre is a result of breeding during the dark days with humans,
when pure-blooded Ogres were known for raping and looting Human villages.
As a result of this, the Half-Ogre stands from six to nine feet tall in
height and is known for its muscle-packed body that can weigh from three
to four hundred pounds.  Most are relatively hairless, their bodies are
covered with small, boney growths, and their disproportionately long
limbs gives them a somewhat simian appearance.
 
This offspring of humans and Ogres has inherited great physical abilities:
an apptitude for aggression from its Ogre lineage, inherent infravision to
assist in traversing darkness, and though slightly smaller than pure-bred
Ogres it nevertheless boasts an awesome strength.  Being territorial, most
Half-Ogres will readily engage in battle to establish superiority over any
it encounters.  All in all a race best suited for the role of pure fighter.
 
Half-Ogres gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.92.
~

0 HALF-ORC HALF-ORCS HALFORC HALFORCS~
&gA recent mingling of Orcish and Human blood arising as the darker races
have encroached further upon the remaining settled areas, most members
of this half-blooded race are distinctly more Orcish than Human in both
appearance and behavior.  Large and dull of wit, with short but broad
bodies, their poor mental and physical dexterity is offset by an iron
constitution.  Though some have dabbled in the sorcerous arts due to
their human influence, brute combat is is still the natural call which
stirs in the soul of the Half-Orc.  All Half-Orcs possess infravision.
 
Though not as broad nor powerful as full-blood Orcs, Half-Orcs usually
retain their wider bodies, longer, bowed limbs and heavier musculature.
A ridged brow crowned by bushy eyebrows conceals small, squinting eyes;
below a snout-like noses opens a maw filled with crooked fangs; dark
skin emanating a rancid odor; their presence disgusts civilized races.
Standing from five to seven feet tall and averaging two hundred pounds,
an altogether fearsome race.
 
Half-Orc's gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.94.
~

0 HALF-TROLL HALFTROLL~
&gAn intermingling (carried out in the darker lands of the Realms) of the
blood of the Troll with that of Humans, the Half-troll is as deadly as
it is hideous. Though considerably smaller than full-blood Trolls, the
Half-troll often stands well over eight feet in height and carries over
three hundred pounds on its heavily-muscled frame. Though naturally of
low wisdom, the race was sorcerously imbued with a wicked intelligence
and the ability to see naturally in the darkness. Half-trolls usually
make poor pure magic users, and suffer from an unusually low dexterity. 
Yet their boundless energy and high intellect create one of the most 
cunning physical beasts of the Realms in experienced hands.
~

0 HALFLING HALFLINGS~
&g
Stout, round, open-minded and very elusive the Hobbit has a level of 
dexterity which is only equal to his wit. Many enjoy the thrill of 
reading a good book, or telling stories by the fire. Many Halflings, 
because of this, tend to avoid adventuring, though some rare hobbits 
choose the path of the Bard, or storyteller, for their keen intellect
serves them well. This intelligence, coupled by a suprising determination
makes them a curious (though somewhat underpowered) ally.

1 'HAON DOR'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 10

The immense forest of Haon Dor stretches westward from Koenraad,
swallowing much of Despair's western landscape. It is a dangerous
forest, populated by many aggressive creatures: wargs and wolves
among them. A single beast rules the forest, given the name Froghemoth
by those who have survived its wrath. Obvious paths to the Shire,
Troll Den, Old Marsh and the city of Solace can be found in Haon Dor,
as well as hidden ones to various other places in Despair.
~

0 HATCHLING~
&g
Hatchlings are legendary and mystical reptilian creatures that, in time, can 
become some of the most powerful creatures in the realm. A full grown dragon 
stands taller than most races, is covered with protective scales, has large 
leathery wings, a powerful tail, long sharp claws, and the ability to utilize 
a distinctive breath weapon against their opponents. Hatchlings are both 
physically powerful and adept at magic. They tend to excel at every endeavor, 
but while they may be strong, they really progress in power quite slowly.
&g
~

1 'HAUNTED HOUSE'~
Recommended level range: 20 - 50
 
Should you stumble into a lonely inn one night, seeking a hot meal and a place
to rest, it is quite possible that you will hear a bard tell the story of a
strange, mystical house that was inhabited by an evil, eccentric sorceror.
Murdered by one of the very beasts he created, the house was left abandoned
to be overrun by the strange beings spawned by the sorceror.  It is rumoured
that the house even nowadays remains haunted by these odd, powerful creatures.
The house now lies in the midst of the Midway of Despair, open for all those
adventurers who are brave (or foolish) enough to enter.

       with that keyword may already exist.
&Y
Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player's prompt. &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors. However there are a couple of quirks to take 
note of:
&Y
    1) At the very least, the first character of a help file cannot be
       either the symbol '&&' or the symbol '^^'.
    2) Color changes have to be separated by at least one character. ie,
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' will cause problems. 
    3) Color codes are imbedded within text and _do_ count in note buffers
       for line length. ie, watch out for <Long Line Trimmed>.
&w
Colors should be used to &Yenhance &wthe help file, or specific parts of the 
help file. Tact and restraint should be used if considering the use of colors.

NOTE: The default level of help file will be set to the writers level.

Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours".  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.
 
You may not hell someone for more than thirty days with the hell command.

If you successfully sneak, you can move from place to place without being
noticed by other player characters.  If you flee, you will stop sneaking
and will have to 'sneak' again.
 
In order to either hide or sneak successfully, you will have to practice
the appropriate skill.
 
Visible (vis) cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
effectively making you visible again to all.

1 'HIGH TOWER OF SORCERY'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 30

Ages ago, when the mortals of Despair were still experimenting with
magic, a coven of archmages deemed that the use of magic needed to
be learned and controlled to avoid terrible disasters. Thus the Guild
of Mages was created, along with the High Tower of Sorcery. After
many attacks from the beings of Darkness, the mages also found it
necessary to weave a powerful grove of shadows around the Tower, so
that only the stoutest adventurers could reach them. Since that time,
the mages of Despair, led by the powerful Mistress of Magic, have
attempted to grasp the idea of magic and understand how it truly works.
Recently, the Guild has gained such respect that Duke Luther has
permitted the building of a Tower of Sorcery in Koenraad.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.

Their high intelligence classify the Holyserra as the best users of 
magical arts.

100 HOLYSIGHT~
&RSyntax: &gcast holysight <character>
 
Holysight is the ultimate perception enhancement tool.
Nothing passes unnoticed to those who use this powerful
spell. The character affected by it becomes able not

character's physical health. When a mob hits you or you are
drowning, your HP start going down. If your hit points get too
low, you will start bleeding which indicates you'd better have
some healing at this point. Your character will die if his hit
points drop below zero.
All classes begin with 20 hp at creation and gain between 6 and 19
hp per gained level, depending on class, race and CON.  Equipment

 keyword <keyword> <help topic>  Sets help keyword to specified keyword
 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page
 
Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in spellcasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

most numerous and the plainest race in the Realms. Although possessing 
no special abilities or bonuses, they are the most adaptable and flexible

deeper than Dwarves and Drow. Some say, with the Uri, this race is one of 
the oldest races to live on this realm, though they only recently emerged 
into the Dwarven mines from their homes. At first some thought they were 
mobiles but that has been disproved due to relational intermaking among 
them and the Dwarves.&D

0 IC FLAME~
&gIC - In Character. This channel is to talk as your character, not you
     as the player behind the screen. If you chose to RP on this channel,
     the personality of your character must stay the same.
 
FLAME - Gripe channel. This channel is an OOC all-purpose channel.  You
         may swear on this channel as much as you want unless someone is
         being targeted over one use and/or direction. Hell,Damn and Damnit
         are acceptable. All others are not and may be dealt with accordingly.
         Harrassment is still a concern here so if one has anything against
         bad language, they should keep this channel off by typing  "channel 
         -flame"  channel +flame/-flame is a toggle turning flame on/off.

1 ICA~
.
Kara's Storm isn't terribly well known for extreme weather conditions
but when the wind desides to blow it doesn't howl, it screams.
On one of Kara's rather fine days, everything seemed to be going well,
it was not untill dark clouds start to roll in, did the creatures of the
land start to seek shelter.

As if conjured by the gods themselves out of nowhere a raging blizzard
appeared, filling the entire horizon with snow and Ice.
 
The storm seemed to last for days, but as fast as the wind itself
the blizzard ceased, and moved on, taking almost everything it had brought.
There in a desert of Snow and Ice stood a wild Uri.
With piercing blue eyes, and tiger like tattoo's on his face, his presence
instills a cold and primal fear within you, his mere aura makes you chill
to the bone, and you dont want to stand to close. Everything he touches
is covered in a layer of cold Frost, and the very ground he stands on
turns to Ice. He doesnt talk to you, but he speaks with his eyes, they are Sad
and intense, he backs away and dissapears into the wind, feeling the need to
be alone.
~

0 ICECHAIN~

Like shields will negate each other's effects.  For example, if your enemy
has fireshield, your fireshield will counter any fireballs thrown by his,
and his will counter any fireballs thrown by yours.

1 IGNORE~
&RSyntax:&g  ignore
&RSyntax:&g  ignore <character>
&RSyntax:&g  ignore reply/none
 
Ignore allows you to ignore other characters in the Realms.  All tells,
says, socials, and emotes from these characters will be blocked (gagged
out).  You will still see their communications through public channels,
however.
 
Simply typing ignore will give you a list of all the characters you are
currently ignoring.
 
Ignore <character> allows you to add or remove a character from your list
of ignored players.  If the name is already on the list it will be removed.
If the name is not on the list it will be added.  Note that only the names
of actual characters will be accepted and that it is not necessary for
them to be logged on at the time.
 
Ignore reply will cause you to ignore the last person to send you a tell.
This can be used to prevent invisible people from spamming you.
 
Ignore none will set you to ignoring no one.

800 'IMM BODYBAG' 'IMM CR'~
&gAssociated help files: Bodybag & CR
 
- You are never required to do a CR for a mortal.
- If you do perform an Immortal CR, you are required to take at least one
  item as charge, this item should be one of the best items the player has.
  ** The only exceptions are a CR for a person under level 10 or if you are
  ** running a quest, and the player died in that quest or you have the
  ** approval from a Council of Elders member.  These qualify for a free CR.
- You may never give free CRs to your friends or for your own mortals.
- You may choose more then one item or gold for a CR, but _must_ inform the
  player of your intent prior to bodybagging them.
- You are never allowed to do a cr for a deadly character.
- Corpses should be at least "crawling with vermin" prior to receiving an
  Immortal CR, i.e. a corpse timer of less then 20.

You may never CR for your own mortal unless _all_ the following apply:
   - There is no other Immortal online to do it for you.
   - You have tried to get your corpse on your own, with mortal assistance.
   - Your corpse is in "the last stages of decay", meaning you cannot wait
     any longer, i.e. a corpse timer of less than 8.

If you perform a CR for one of your -own- mortal characters, you must:
   - Take at least one of the better/best items from your mortal, and eat it.
   - Post a note on 1220 stating that you cr'd your own mortal's corpse.
 
***** See 'help timer' to get a list of corpse decay timer and messages.

800 'IMM ECHO'~
&gAssociated help files: echo

Echos should generally be medieval in nature, and their use confined
primarily to administrative functions, weddings, quest, role-playing
and the like.  Role-playing should be used rarely, however.
 
Though there is some leeway within these guidelines, some practices
are frowned upon and should be avoided.  Do not use your name in an echo
unless necessary.  Avoid comical phrases or 'cutsey' terms.  Do not use
:) or other symbols/punctuations at all.
 
If any of the above are necessary, there exist a sufficient number of
public channels via which the task can be accomplished while still
reaching a wide audience -  without forcing it onto the screen of
every character in the game.
~

800 'IMM EQUIP~
.                       Equipment Usage
                       ---------------
**  All equipment worn by an immortal must be made from vnum 1222.
**  No stats or affects may be added to vnum 1222.
**  If you need to test your mobs, you may make a weapon with the
    stats needed to test your mob.
~

800 'IMM FORCE'~
&gAssociated help files: force
 
This command allows you to make someone execute a command.  Forcing
someone can often be looked at as high-handed.  Most common use of
force is to make someone do something as you are snooping, to check
problems or bugs, without waiting having to tell the character exactly
what to type.  It is always best to ask the person before you begin
forcing them.  You may also use force to make a player quit, drop,
or read something when you are punishing them.  
 
Force all <command> can be done, but causes excessive lag because it
causes every player lower than you to attempt the command.  This should
be reserved to "force all save" in times of numerous crashes.  You should
never force all to use a channel.
~

800 'IMM FORCECLOSE'~
&g
Associated help files: forceclose
 
This command will force a certain descriptor to close.  To use, you
must first look for the number listed under Desc on the user list.
Then type: forceclose <Desc #>
 
You can use forceclose to knock a trouble player offline, as well as
knock off someone who it stuck online.
~

800 'IMM FREEZE'~
Associated help files: help freeze
 
&RSyntax:&g deny         <character>
&RSyntax:&g disconnect   <character>
&RSyntax:&g freeze       <character>
 
DENY denies access to a particular player and throws them out of the game.  
Deny is permanent (persists across reboots) and is not undoable from within
the game.  Only someone with access to the player files directory may repeal
a DENY by editing the appropriate player file.
 
DISCONNECT <character> immediately disconnects that character.
 
FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all.
~

800 'IMM GOTO'~
&RSyntax:&g goto <name>

This is a reminder to use common courtesy when using such commands
as goto.   Not only is it considered inappropriate to goto higher
level immortals without asking permission, the same could be said
when wanting to visit any player on the mud.  A quick tell requesting
to visit would suffice.  For those of you who frequent headquarters,
either Clans, Guilds or Orders, requesting permission, though not
necessary, is certainly welcome.  Note that if a mortal requests that
you leave their hq, and you have no pressing business, you are obligated
to abide by their wishes.  (This does not apply to high ranking immortals.)
 
~

800 'IMM INVIS'~
&g
Associated help files: invis and wizinvis
 
Those Immortals between levels 800 and 840 may invis to level 800 when they
are running or preparing a quest, involved in a building projects that
requires you to be uninterrupted, or you are actively watching a mortal.
At all other times, the Immortal should be visible to all levels of mortals
and Immortals.  Wizinvis is to be used as a tool to assist you in your duties
as an Immortal, it is not a means to spy on others or hide.
 
Immortals of level 850 and above may use wizinvis beyond 820 to work on
projects or monitor another person.  It is mandatory to be visible to all
other immortals whenever reasonably able to do so.  Keep the use of
"Someone" to a minimum on channels.  Exceptions are when you need to answer
a question, make a comment, or pass on some information, but are too busy
to become visible.
~

800 'IMM RECHO'~
&gAssociated help files: recho
 
Rechos should generally be medieval in nature, and their use confined
primarily to administrative functions, weddings, quest, role-playing
and the like.  Recho can be seen by all players in one room.  Do not 
use recho to "scare" mortals.  Recho is seen on logs, be cautious in
using them in social/private situations.
~

800 'IMM SNOOP'~
&gAssociated help files: snoop

The snoop command is a very valuable tool, when used appropriately.  Snoop
not only allows you to watch another person, but to see the world through
their eyes, helping to track down problems the person may be experiencing.
The reasons for snooping are too varied to mention here, but the reasons
NOT to snoop are easily listed.
 
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
   snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- If a higher level Immortals requests you to stop snooping, do so quickly.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.

800 IMMAUTH AUTH AUTHORIZE~
Associated help file: Authorize

IMPORTANT!!!!! If there is a player applying with a (NEWBIE) tag,
please, let the mudschool work and DO NOT AUTH THEM, only use auth
if they need to change their names!!!!!
 
&RSyntax:&g
&Gauthorize <name> <yes|name|immsim|mobsim|swear|plain|unpronu|no/deny>
 
Authorize is used to allow a new player to start his or her character.
Names must not be offensive or similar to an existing immortal (within a
letter or two).  Names like "Braveheart" are acceptable even though they
are not normally considered "proper" names.  Players are allowed to use
names of mobs ... but not extremely popular mobs.
Use your best judgement when authorizing a name.
 
You may use the abbreviation "a" for authorize and the abbreviation "n" 
for name.  In addition, you only need to type as much of a name to uniquely
identify it.
 
So, for example, if Goixetoika is awaiting authorization,

a                shows pending authorizations
a g              allows the name
a g n            requires player to change name
a g no           denies name and forces player off (offensive name)
~

800 IMMEQ~
&RSyntax:&g immeq <char>
Loads the default immortal equipment on the target character.
 
&RNOTE: &gUse only on IMMORTALS.

800 IMMHOST~
&RSyntax:&g  immhost add    <name> <host>
&RSyntax:&g  immhost delete <name> <host>
&RSyntax:&g  immhost save
&RSyntax:&g  immhost
This command is for setting the hosts allowed for immortals that are added
with this command.  Wildcards are allowed (*), so *edu, would allow any domain
from edu connect and 127*, would allow any local domain to connect.
IMMHOST without arguments will show a list of names and what domains they are
allowed to connect from.
To delete a command you need to provide the name and the host, this allows
for multiple hosts for a certain name.
This file won't be saved until the immhost save command is issued.
~

0 IMMORTAL~
&RImmortals &g(or Imms) of Kara's Storm are the people who build, manage and
maintain the game. Once a player reaches level 800, he or she is considered
an Immortal. The Immortals that run this game receive no payment, in
fact, some of them pay for this game to run at all. The immortals expect 
in return from players the following:
 
     - play by the rules (help rules)
     - show a little appreciation for the work they put in
     - as we work hard to make the game a better place to stay, players are
       encouraged to report bugs, typo errors and ideas
 
Keep in mind that immortals don't give free spellups, katyr, equipment or
any such gifts to players unless they deserved it.
Please address questions to an imm starting from the lowest rank and work 
up the list. (help immranks)
~

920 IMMORTALIZE~
&RSyntax:&g  immortalize <char> (helps/build/head/enforcer/advisor/admin)
 
This command allows an Immortal, Head Builder level and up to bring in
a new player as an Immortal of a certain rank.
 
For the Syntax, you can specify a rank level if you choose.  However, if
you do not, they will be brought in as a Visitor.

  Currently imms &YARE&G allowed to quest.
 
&WRules for imm's questing:&G
 
 &W*&G It is expected that no Imm will be multi-playing their imm while they
   are questing.  This includes multi-playing while invis/afk/etc.
 
 &W*&G It is expected that no imm will log off their imm character in order to
   quest.  We don't want the situation arising where everyone logs off and the
   QC imm is stranded running the quest and fielding everything else.
 
 &W*&G You may &CNOT&G quest if you log in with your imm at any time during
   the quest.
 
&WSo when can you quest?&G
 
 &W*&G It's somewhat limiting, but you can quest &CIF&G you happen to be 
   morting when a quest begins, &COR&G if you are given the explicit
   permission of the imm running the quest. &CPlease do not pressure them.&G
 
 
Immortals can apply once a month for a rename scroll or twenty glory.
Phalanx, on behalf of the Quest Council, and Elcid on behalf of the
Symposium are responsible for the distribution of the monthly 'payments.'
To apply for your monthly rename or share of glory, post a note on 1203
stating the month, the form in which you'd like to receive your payment
(scroll/glory), and the mortal's name that will be receiving the payment.

0 IMMROLE~
&gImmortals are extremely important in keeping Kara's Storm running
smoothly.  They play many diffent roles, and handle any kind of 
character problems, such as equipment reimbursements, offensive 
behavior, and inter-character problems.  Immortals also aid in the 
improvement of Kara's Storm by suggesting or even writing new 
features for the MUD.  They edit, write and fix areas.  Immortals 
occasionally run quests and contests. Immortals are here to answer 
your questions to the best of their ability or help you find someone 
who can answer your questions.
 
Immortals on Kara's Storm do not provide "divine intervention" to 
mortals. DO NOT expect an Imm to help you level, give you free 
equipment (and you cannot pay for equipment either), perform 
corpse retrievals - except in rare circumstances at the discretion 
of the Immortal, give you levels except in cases of certain quest or 
contest rewards, or give you gold. It is considered improper to ask 
for intervention as it might be considered cheating which would be 
punishable by denial for both the Immortal and the mortal involved.
 
If for some reason something unusual happens and it is necessary to 
discuss it with an Immortal, please find the most junior Imm on at the 
time. Reimbursements, information you have about possible causes of 
crashes, or inter-character quarrels are all good examples of things 
that imms expect to be asked to correct.  It is important to respect the 
role of an Immortal, as they work hard to improve Kara's Storm.
~

800 IMMRULES~
&gHere are the rules for Immortal characters.  They are to be followed
as well as those from RULES. Also see COMMAND_ABUSE.
 
1) Invis
* Trusted level 605 and under as well as level 602 Imms should be
visible at all times except when told by a higher imm to go invis.
 
2) Corpse Retrievals
* Mortals should attempt to get mortal help first
 
3) Silencing
* Insulting of an individual which is witnessed by an Immortal.
* Usage of foul language beyond minor offenses (under imms discretion)
* Prolonged discussion of sexual acts requires one public warning that 
  further communication will result in silencing.
 
4) Helling
* Do not abuse.  Talk to the offender and use as necessary.
* Accessive abuse of mortal rules.
* Comment
 
5) Snooping
* Not for personal reason, and any personal information received is private
* Snoop only for the time needed to accomplish objective.
 
6) Disputes Between Immortals
* Handle them privately and NOT ON PUBLIC CHANNELS.

 7) Titles
 * Please keep your titles from being 'the (null)'

 8) Donation rooms
 * DO NOT PURGE, EAT OR JUNK ANYTHING here. Punishment will be swift!
 
As always discretion is best suited for all areas of dispute and controversy.
If you have a question, bring it to my attention.
 
                                   Thanks,
                                       Nicole

1 'IN THE AIR'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 10

The skies above Koenraad are unpopulated save for the amusing

exists at the end of a rainbow high above the city.
~

1 INCONNU~
The ancient Inconnu strive endlessly to attain Golconda, the personal
perfection of knowledge, ability, and control over the bestial self.
The mastery of one aspect serves only to mark a beginning anew of the
trek for perfection down new paths.  Largely indifferent to joy or
sorrow, pleasure or pain, and choosing to live in relative seclusion
from the world they often despise, the Inconnu care little for their
lesser brethren yet harbor no inherent desire to bring harm.  Slow to
anger, but formidable when aroused, their elder status and power
affords them an uncommon respect.
 
~

2 INDUCT OUTCAST~
&RSyntax:&g  induct  <player> <member/one/two/leader>
         outcast <player>
 
Induct and outcast are clan commands.  The leader and number 1 of the

This spell makes you more resistant to all forms of coldness.
~

920 INSTA INSTAR INSTAZ INSTAROOM INSTAZONE~

INSTAROOM sets the resets for a room. Type it after completing each room.
 
INSTAZONE sets the resets for an entire area. Type it once you have completed
any minor changes made to an area.
 
~

920 INSTALLAREA~
&RSyntax:&g installarea <area filename> <full area name/title>

Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.
The filename can be fixed with aset, (don't forget to foldarea the new name.)

Currently the builder should quit and have his/her vnums cleared manually.
(This should be fixed soon).
~

1 INT INTELLIGENCE~
&gIntelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - heavily influences the amount of mana a character gains at level
 
 - affects the amount of mana regenerated or recovered at each tick
   if a character is resting or sleeping
 
 - the rate at which a character learns a new skill or spell
 
 - the percentage rate at which a character practices a new language
 
Intelligence is an important factor in learning between combatants.  If
a character fights a creature several times, the more intelligent of the
two opponents will gain an advantage over time...
 
Intelligence is the prime attribute of the mage.
 
~

0 INTERACT_IMM_PLAYER~
&g
Knowing when and which immortals to talk to can be frustrating at times
but this help should make it abit easier.
 
1) Ask over channels such as chat to the general immortal that is visable.
   ie. chat is there an imm that can answer my questions?
   or, chat Could I be a testor for a class?

   The first example is preferable though, that will give the imm or imms
   time to respond in a more personal way. Request to talk with an immortal
   in their office. NEVER ask for a tell if at all possible. Its considered
   rude.

2) If you must use tell, start with the lowest ranking imm on who imm. If you
    don't, your question can be ignored or you could be disconnected. 
 
3) After the imm responds, don't argue with the imm. This is considered very
   rude and disrespectful.
 
4) If the imm decides to talk with you personally, keep it personal. This
   means no talking about it over channels.
 
Any questions can be made with an e-mail: oferi@karastorm.org subject interact.

~

0 INVINCIBILITY~
&RSyntax:&g cast invincibility <character>

Invincibility is a powerful clerical spell that lowers (improves) your armor

~

800 IPCOMPARE~
&RSyntax:&g ipcompare <name>
        ipcompare <site>
        ipcompare <name or site> <room|area|world> <#>
 
This takes * as a wild card.
Ipcompare will compare online users to search for multiplayers. A positive
match using ipcompare does not always mean it is a multiplayer..but shows
that there are more than one user from a site on simultaneously.
Ipcompare <field> <#> will limit the output to x number of lines based on #.
* may be used as a wild card, for example ipcompare 207.18.3.* will return
matches from any that begin with the ip prior to the asterisk.
Ipcompare <field> <room|area|world> will limit the search based on that
criteria.  The room|area|world limitation will be judged on the room that
the immortal issued the command in.  So if you are in a different area
than the victim, it will show only players matching the site in the area
you are in.

making it as hard as iron and affects the armor class by

donation room and you do not receive katyr for it as you would if you 
sacraficed it. It simply... Disappears. Use of this command should be 
careful. Owned items that are junked will not be reimbursed. For the 
item to be junked it must first be present in your inventory.

0 KHESEKH~
Before you hovers, more than stands something. A three-dimensional silhouette,
rather than an actual body. An entity formed of pure blood thirst and the rage
of a predator.
Hollow slits of malignantly glowing purple, rather than eyes turn in your
direction and you feel the preternatural sight within them focus on you, or
rather your lifeforce, however weak it may seem, compared to the Void
before you.
Terrible, dark ivory fangs are bared by a suddenly forming maw, in a vicious
grin, expressing nought but an intense desire to sink them into your veins
and draw out not only your blood, but your very soul as well.
Fingers are flexed and slowly, fluidly form into fearsome claws, as the
apparition takes a step toward you.
"Come", it beckons, "I have such sights to show you. Sights of pain and
pleasure indivisible." The voice has a ring to it that can only be described
as the cut of a silken sword.
In the background you hear a whispering choir chant a dark and sinister litany.
&r "Blessed be the Darkness, Praise be the Night,
Mighty is the Void, Accursed is the Light.
Into the Night, Hunt every Hour. Savour the Blood, Relish the Power.

Kianen rose from the depths of nowhere, ascending to immortality
by an unknown force. He reached a high rank of immortality
and now spends his time changing the realms. He is a small
male pixie, with soft purple eyes, short blonde hair and
transparent gossamer wings that stretch the whole length of his
slightly tanned body. He does not visit Koenraad often, but
when he does, he often leaves small deposits of gold.

0 KILLER KILLERFLAG KILLERFLAGS~
&gThe mud will automatically assign you a &RKiller &gflag if you cause the
death of another player. Only situations which involve peacefuls being
killed by mortals, or &RDeadlies &gkilling fellow clanmembers will result
in the assignment of this flag. You will receive a &RKiller &gflag if:
 
  1. You caused the DEATH of another player, regardless of who attacked first.
  To help prevent yourself from acquiring a &RKiller &gflag after being
  attacked, set yourself to &RConfig +Nice &g(See Help Config for info).
 
  2. You were the Master of a mobile which killed another player while
  under the influence of your charm. PLEASE NOTE that you will receive a
  &RKiller &gflag even if the player that died attacked the charmed
  mobile without the Master's permission. Charmers and Pet Owners are held
  responsible for the actions of their Pets/Charmies. (See Help Charm
&g  and Help Pets for more info on these topics).

&g  3. You are a &RDeadly &gplayer and caused the death of a fellow Clanmember.
 
&gKoenraad Guards, shopkeepers and special function mobs now respond
differently to illegal flags. You may find yourself barred from making
puchases, placed before Judge Kendra for a hearing, sentenced to
jail. You may apply to Judge Kendra in person to seek removal of the flag. 
She is located one west of the Main Lobby in the Townhall.

0 KING 'KING CASTLE' 'KINGS CASTLE' 'THE KING CASTLE' 'THE KINGS CASTLE'~
Recommended level range: 25 - 40
 
The castle of Good King Welmar was built ages ago near the city of Thalos. 
Upon the city's destruction, it lay empty for many years, many claiming it 
was cursed along with Thalos. However, when our King Welmar united the five 
great cities and thus created hope in the battle against Darkness, he found 
himself without a keep. Risking death, he and his troups crossed through the 
ruins of Thalos, eventually reaching the magnificent, impregnable fortress. 
The castle now stands as a tribute to honor, good and law.
~

1 'KINGDOM OF JUARGAN'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 25

The mighty dwarven Kingdom of Juargan was once a powerful influence
in the battle against Darkness. Sealed within their impregnable city,
any attack against them was scoffed at. However, one day centuries
ago, the great mountain kingdom sealed its gates and refused to
communicate with any of the other races. The reason for their desertion
is still unknown, but many have found hidden entrances into their vast
underground complex.

1 KONTAUR~
Recommended level range:  25 - 50
 
 
Among the most corrupt of the lands of Despair, is Kontaur, which lies
south of the Old Marsh. Once a lush forest filled with wild vegetation
and beautiful sylvan and elven races, it is now the heart of evil in the
southern lands. The cause of the land's devastation is not completely
known. Sages believe that either Laschte or Vl'arescht opened a gate to
a race of astral travelers known as the Carnifex, which brought legions
of balrogs to Despair long ago. The balrogs waged war against all sentient
races, seeking to destroy at the leisure of their masters. The avatars of
Koenraad were truly oppressed and fought for their very lives against
this evil army. After years of war, the Carnifex were finally driven across
the Pits of Banishment and into a legendary castle from which they could not
escape. Without their masters' guidance, the balrogs lost their edge and
began losing the war. They retreated to Kontaur, the first realm they had
conquered, and erected a castle. Although there have been many attempts to
destroy the Balrog race, none have succeeded. Many new races have come to
the forests of Kontaur recently, and made the Realms even more perilous.
Foul pixie that were corrupted by Laschte, savage beastmen and, Vl'arescht's
creation, the moblins; allguard the paths to and from the Kontaur castle.
Yet there lies a shining hope in this foul land, for A'enaar lifted her
hand and protected a tribe of forest elves known as the Misinkii.

920 KSBUILDING~
**** HELP FILE FOR IMMORTALS / BUILDERS ****
 
&RThe main rule&g - The Head Builder is the first person whom you should go
with ANY query that is related to the building of areas, if you have a
question that you believe should go to an Imm of higher level than the
Head Builder, you should still go through him. 
Remember chain of command.
 
&WBEFORE&g starting on ANY new area, you should check with the Head Builder
with the following checklist
- Level ranges for area
- Any special requirements that may be needed for the area
- Any special mobs that you wish to place in the area
- Any special equipment that you wish to place in the area
- Size of area (large areas may need specific permission)
- Allocation of extra Vnum ranges if area is to be large
- Future placement ideas for area
 
Please remember that there is a reference chart for mob creation.
This will outline what the average damage, hitdice, AC, and HitPoints
that a mob should have for any specific level. It will also outline
the relation between mob level and character level for the area.
This chart was not just created to pass our time, it was created so that
there will be matching standards in areas created by different people.
 
You &WWILL&g be required to have your area checked before it is integrated
into the mud. There WILL be a feedback form that will be filled in by the
person who is checking your area, this WILL be sent back to you.
Please pay attention to any comments that have been raised, especially in
the changing of any mob, object or room. The reasons for this are
1 - Areas need to follow set standards
2 - We need to check for undesirable language or description
 
When you get your area feedback, please do not grouch or complain, the
feedback was implemented in order to help you create better areas.
As always, if you have a complaint, take it to the Head Builder FIRST.
 
&RIMPORTANT&g
Please remember that as with any normal game, we have to pay attention
to copyright laws. Please make sure that the names which you give to
areas, rooms, mobs, objects, etc. have to be compliant with international
copyright law. DO NOT use names which you have read in a book, seen on TV
or a movie. If you are in any doubts, no matter how small, that you may
be using a name that may infringe these rules, check with the Head Builder
BEFORE creating the item, room, or mob.

1 'LAND OF THE FIRE NEWTS'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 20

The Land of the Fire Newts lies beneath a portion of Moria known as the
obsidian hills. This strange race is very secretive, attacking all
who intrude upon their home. Due to their reclusiveness, it has never
been known how they came to be or what their true goals are. Also, as they
remain neutral in the battle between Light and Darkness, none have ever
made an attempt to exterminate them.

990 LANG-OLD~
LANGUAGE   'RULES-LANGUAGE'

Tact and Timing are everything...

Kara's Storm is a FAMILY mud. We have regular players from 8 to nearly 60.
Players do not always reveal how old they are, even in groups, so determining
RL age may be difficult or impossible. Kara's Storm players log in from the US,
Canada, UK, Australia, and other countries, so 'late night' for you is morning
for some and after school for others.

Crude, rude and socially unacceptable language, behavior, and topics are 
NEVER suitable on public channels. This includes player names and titles. 
Flaming (verbal abuse of a player, class, or race) is not permitted.Chat, 
music, ask, answer, nchat, joke, and auction are public channels. Private 
discussions / comments / disagreements should be limited to 'insulated' 
channels  (gtell, tell ) or 'say' in otherwise unoccupied rooms.

Obvious dodges (you A$$!) are not acceptable, but we have all been humiliated
by the inadvertent keystroke that renders a 'private' conversation visible to
all.  Similarly, intent can be a factor. Typing 'don all' instead of 'donate
all.item can result in an UNCHARACTERISTIC outburst from a stressed player:

'$#*#! Just donated everything!' After a few rounds of 'LANGUAGE!!' help may
be, in fact, forthcoming. But calling another player a 'little $#*#' on a 
public channel would be a serious error, resulting in silencing or worse. 
You may suggest Hell as a hunting ground, but you may not tell a player
to 'go to hell'.

The music channel is public and presents a curious paradox: some current 
music features lyrics that would be unacceptable on public channels.  In 
general if it is played on the radio or MTV it is ok, but we request discretion
Using  'music' for unacceptable 'chat' is not in the spirit of the game. Player
may also toggle off the music channel by typing 'channel -music'

The joke channel presents another challenge. Language, subject and nuance
should be appropriate to a public channel.

In general, we simply request respect for other players, the family orientation
of Kara's Storm and the spirit of the game. Your local imm is the final arbiter
of what is appropriate...please honor a request to tone things down.

2 LAST~
LAST will show when a player was last on and their current level.
~

-1 'LAW ASSIST'~
.
&GA non-deadly may give, sell or trade scrolls, potions and equipment
with a deadly character.
 
A non-deadly character may spy for a deadly character.
 
A non-deadly may _not_ shield, heal, summon, help, hinder, portal or
otherwise assist a deadly character (this includes charm).
 
~

-1 'LAW CHANNELS'~
.
&GSpam (repeating the same message repeatedly or otherwise purposely causing
the screen to scroll), harassment (including sexual) and abusive behavior are
not permitted on any channel (this includes in 'say' or 'tell').  Do not
continue to 'tell' to someone after they have asked you to stop.
 
Profanity is not permitted on any public channel, which is a channel seen by
those other than yourself and the person to whom you are speaking.  If you
use profanity in a private conversation and the other party asks you to stop,
please respect their wishes.  The difference between '****, I'm having a bad
day' and 'what is your ****** problem' should be obvious to everyone.
 
If any level of Immortal asks you to desist on a subject, or to move the
subject to an appropriate channel, do so immediately.  Continuing on a
subject or channel after you are requested to stop may result in your
character losing its access to channels through silencing.  An Immortal's
decision on subject matter and/or channel use should be obeyed.
 
&WWarning:  &GArguing with or flaming immortals on channels _will_ get you
silenced or worse, and this may extend to your other characters as well if
you push the matter.  The Realms provides ample avenue for complaint without
resorting to public baiting and name-calling.
 
~

-1 'LAW CHARM'~
.
&GDo not bring aggressive mobs into or near Koenraad, as when their charm
wears off (either naturally or by attack) their aggressive nature will
return.  Also do not bring aggressive mobs into areas which are lower in
level than the area from which the mob originally came.  You can use the
'areas' command to check an area's level.  See 'help charm' for more.
 
~

-1 'LAW CHEATING'~
.
&GCheating is a very serious offense and subjects _all_ characters involved
to a slay, purge (loss of all equipment), freeze, balzhur (destruction of
all equipment and public demotion to level 2), deny or even a site ban.
 
What is considered cheating?
 - exploiting (intentionally using) a bug to gain equipment or gold
 - intentionally causing the system to crash
 - intentionally duplicating equipment or gold
 - knowingly accepting illegal equipment (see above) from others
 - attempting to duplicate equipment or gold -- * even if not successful *
 - using or making profit from equipment that was accidentally duplicated
 - using gold that was accidentally duplicated
 
Cheating hurts the game, and every player in the game.  Protect yourself
and report any bugs you find, and inform the Immortals if you have strong
cause to believe someone is engaged in any of the above. 
 
If you find you have accidentally duplicated an item, turn the item over
_immediately_ to an Immortal or drop and sacrifice the item.
 
~

-1 'LAW HARASSMENT'~
.
&GHarassment is giving a person unwanted attention, whether you perceive it
as negative or positive attention.  If a person is made to be uncomfortable
by your attention or comments, you are harassing that person.  If a person
asks you to desist in talking to them or performing socials on them, and
you do not stop, you are harassing that person.  If you act in an intimate
manner to a character, without their permission, you are harassing that
person.
 
No form of harassment is tolerated in the Realms.  We especially frown upon
unwanted comments or actions with a sexual nature or explicit content.  If
you do not have an intimate relationship with the person, whether in real
life or within the Realms, you should refrain from using suggestive actions
and/or comments.
 
If you are caught harassing another player in any way, you can be silenced,
helled, frozen, denied, and/or site banned.  Harassing another player is a
serious violation of the rules and will not be permitted.  If you choose
to harass an immortal, you will simply be deleted.
 
~

-1 'LAW KILLSTEAL'~
Don't do it...
 
Kill stealing occurs when a player attacks a mob that is already being
fought.  This is both highly annoying and illegal.  If someone should do
this to you please inform them of the rules (ask them to read 'laws
killsteal').  If they continue, seek an immortal but do not take the law
into your own hands.
 
~

0 LAW LAWS~
&g.
&gThe Realms are governed by a set of laws, most of which are simple common
sense and courtesy, and all of which must be followed to ensure everyone
the opportunity to enjoy the game.  As with any mud, a player's presence
here is a priviledge, not a right, and is something we reserve the right
to deny at any time at our discretion.
 
The Immortals of the Realms are responsible for enforcing these laws, and
their decisions these matters should be abided.  If you feel an Immortal
has treated you unfairly, you may petition directly to a level 900
or higher or you may petition via a note at the Oracle.
 
The decisions of a God or higher are final.  To see which Immortals are
online and visible, type "who 800" at any time.
 
To read the laws, type "laws <topic>" for any of the following:
&W 
       |  CHANNELS      |  PKILL     |  STORES  |  HARASSMENT  |
       |  MULTIPLAYING  |  SHARING   |  STAKE   |  CHARM       |
       |  OBJECTS       |  CHEATING  |  MURDER  |  ASSIST      |
 
&gFor further explanation, see section 2 of the Adventurer's Guide...
~

-1 'LAW MURDER'~
.
&GPlayer killing is decided the instant you cast any hostile spell or make
any aggressive action against a non-deadly player.  Actually killing the
target means little.  The only form of player killing allowed is between
players whose names appear on "who deadly" section of the who list.  A
battle between non-deadly characters is still illegal even if those who
are involved have agreed to the combat.
 
Being involved in an illegal pkill is a serious violation of law, and can
result in a stay in hell, slay, loss of all equipment, freeze and/or deny
or site ban. 
 
~

-1 'LAW OBJECTS'~
.
&GIf you notice an item on the ground and there is a player in the room with
it, do _not_ pick it up without first getting permission from the person<s>
in the room.  Taking such items may be considered stealing if you do not
first obtain permission from those present.
 
Do not simply take an item to identify it without asking permission.  If
you are asked to drop an item you picked up, do so immediately.
 
Do not take items laying next to a corpse, even if no one is present,
without asking the owner of the corpse if the item(s) belong to them.
 
Do not take items from a mob corpse unless you made the kill yourself or
you have specific permission from the character who made the kill.  This
includes removing gold from a corpse.
 
* &WWarning:&G  It is never wise to leave items or containers unattended and
  expect them to be there when you return.  If there is an item on the
  ground and there is neither a corpse nor a player in the room, the
  object is considered abandoned and free for the taking.
 
~

-1 'LAW PKILL'~
.
&GDeadly Characters are those which appear on the who list under the section
titled "Deadly Characters" (type 'who deadly').  A character must be level
5 _and_ 18 years of age to officially become deadly; if you are a pkill
character who doesn't fill these criteria yet, you will not appear under
'who deadly' and are _not_ yet able to pkill.
 
Deadly characters may &Wnot&G:
 a) multi-play while using a deadly character
 b) be shared
 c) receive help (healing, shielding, portaling, etc.) from non-deadlies
 d) receive Immortal corpse retrievals or reimbursements - no exceptions
 e) attack players more than 5 levels outside their own
    - includes picking up disarmed weapons from someone outside your range
    - includes healing a fighting character outside your range
    - includes looting the corpse of someone outside your level range
 
Deadly characters are allowed to:
 a) pkill another player who appears on the deadly
    list (who deadly) who is within 5 levels of their own.
 b) loot the corpse of the fallen deadly player, provided they were
    the tank or delt the killing blow.
 c) use mobs within or lower than the pkill level range of the victim
 
&WWarning&G:  Going AFK or link-dead in a non-safe area leaves you open to
attack; a deadly is open to attack every second online, link-live or not.
 
~

-1 'LAW SHARING'~
.
&GCharacter sharing (when allowed) is always done at the risk of the players
involved.  Immortals will &Wnot&G recover any character lost to trading or
sharing.  Whoever owns the password owns the character.
 
A character may &Wnot&G be shared if:
 - the character is a deadly character
 - the character holds any leadership position in a Guild or Order
 
~

-1 'LAW SPAM'~
No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to PUT A LID ON IT and force-quit you after the 20th
repeat of a single command
 
It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use
capitals to add emphasis to key words in a sentence.
 
Moving a large number of items into and out of a container in a crowded, 
non-store room is considered spam.  Using multiple characters to chat the
same message at the same time is considered spam.  Making charmed mobs
or pets to cause screen scroll through movement or orders is considered
spam. ANYTHING that causes excessive or irritating screen scroll can be
considered spam.
 
~

-1 'LAW STAKE'~
.
&GThe first player to attack a mob has the rights to the kill.  Others should
not get involved without being requested to do so.  Those receiving aid are 
under no obligation to reward their benefactors.  Monopolization of a mob and
its repops will not be tolerated.
 
Any disputes brought to the attention of an immortal for resolution will be
handled according the the immortal's discretion.  All such decisions are final.
~

-1 'LAW STORES'~
.
&GShopkeepers inside Koenraad are protected by the laws of the city's Lord,
Duke Luther.  As the gods have pledged their favor to Koenraad, they have
imbued these shopkeepers with the powers necessary to carry out retribution
against those who defy these laws.  In short, anyone who chooses to attack
a Koenraad shopkeeper will die brutally.  In addition, they may find
themselves facing the direct wrath of the gods in hell...
 
Those caught stealing from these shopkeepers will be incarcerated by the
guards of the Duke until such time as their release is granted by the gods.
 
A Koenraad shopkeeper is any mob inside Koenraad at which you can type
'list'.  If you are given a list of items for sale, or are told to try
back later, it is a shopkeeper.  This also applies to guild shopkeepers
and the blacksmith.
 
~

1 LCK LUCK~
&gLuck (LCK in your 'score') represents the tendency of a character to succeed
or prosper through chance or good fortune.  As in life, the exact extent of
this factor remains and will always remain shrouded in uncertainty...
 
Also as in life, however, it can be said with surety that its influence on a
character is pervasive.  Though it affects some aspects of life here in a
very direct manner, it can affect nearly every aspect to at least a degree.

&g
Lizardmen are semi-aquatic, breathing air but often dwelling totally 
underwater. They are often noted to use underwater caves as their lair,
and are typically found in swamps, marshes, and similar places. Members
of this race band together in rough tribal form, they are omnivores, and
are likely to prefer human flesh to other foods. Due to this taste for
humans, they suffer if their alignment strays too much towards the
honorable side of the spectrum.

~

800 LOADUP~
&RSyntax:&g  loadup <player>
 
LOADUP allows one to load up a player's character (playing or not), to do
whatever needs be done to the character.  (Modifying a flag, changing a
password... etc).  Use FORCE to make the character do your bidding.
 
If we make any changes to the char, we comment the char and place a note in
their inventory explaining who loaded them up and what changes were made.
The character is transed to room 99 and forced to quit there (unless they
are going to be left in hell).  If we don't make any changes to the char, we
trans them back from where they came and force quit them there.  Loadup is
used primarily when a player quits to avoid dealing with immortals or if
they quit before you finish writing a comment.  But it is also used to
investigate chars for duping and other allegations made against them.
 
So... there is actually a wide range of reasons to use loadup and you are
encouraged to use your discretion in this area.
 
If you load up a character to slay or purge them, you must post in 1205.

800 LOG SNOOP~
&RSyntax:&g log   <character>
&RSyntax:&g log   all
&RSyntax:&g snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.
The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the players 
name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
     snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded
    ** For example, you hear someone is having a mud affair, it is not
    ** important to the reason you are snooping.  Do not judge or pass
    ** on information learned in this manner.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.

0 MAGICUSER MAGE MAGES~
&gA mage is one of the weakest classes when it comes to body, but the mage
is a being of pure magic.  Their minds are by far the sharpest, retaining
the knowledge of some of the worlds most powerful spells.  When one begins
as a mage the body is weak.  As they grow in knowledge, experience and
power.  They will become a powerful fighting force.  Armed with an
arsenal of various spells, with the main focus in combat spells.  Their
vast repertoire of spells makes them a sought after commodity in the
Realms for their spells can mean victory or defeat for others.  A mage
must constantly study their spells for they are quickly forgotten, ruled
by the three moons, the silver moon of good, the red moon of neutrality
and the fabled black moon of evil.  A mage has a choice of either using
their powers for good or for evil.

1 MAI~
&g
In the days before there were warlords and shifting planes, there was the 
legend of the one known as Mai. She was more than a fairy tale. Mai was
thought to be able to crush the very soul of a man with her mind, and heal 
the same man with her kiss. Mai, among the most beautiful, faded as every 
fairy tale, into that of books read only by children. One day, a young woman
with the name Haruko was prophesied to be that very Mai that we dreamt of.  
She excelled in everything from clericism to the very root of archery.  She 
soon took on the title of Mai and now dwells deep within the heart's of men's 
souls.

-1 MENTALSTATE MENTALSTATES 'MENTAL STATE' 'MENTAL STATES'~
.
&gYour mental state is your current frame of mind, and how clearly and
realistically you view your surroundings.  Mental states can be affected
by prolonged combat, hunger, thirst, or poison.  If you are affected by
one of the above for a period of time, your mental state will begin to
deteriorate, and you will not view your surroundings as they truly are.
You may begin to hallucinate, or become too lethargic to function, and
your general abilities will be affected.  In extreme cases you may
collapse from exhaustion or enter a delirious coma.
 
To restore your mental state, you may need to rest (resting and sleeping
will speed your recovery), eat, cure whatever poison afflicts you, etc.
Note that if you are malnourished your state will &wnot&g improve, even with
sleep, until you have fed and/or quenched your thirst.
 
Your mental state is by the text line in 'score' which describes your state
of mind (You feel great, etc.)  The 'group' display contains a less accurate
reading of your and your group-mates' mentalstates as well.
 
Note:  Changing your deity now affects your mental state.

&g------------------------[&RSomething New]&g-----------------------------&W
A writer in 1947 wrote, "I don't really care how time is reckoned so long
as there is some agreement about it, but I object to being told that I am 
saving daylight when my reason tells me that I am doing nothing of the kind.
I even object to the implication that I am wasting something valuable if I 
stay in bed after the sun has risen. As an admirer of moonlight I resent the 
bossy insistence of those who want to reduce my time for enjoying it. At the 
back of the Daylight Saving scheme I detect the bony, blue-fingered hand of
Puritanism, eager to push people into bed earlier, and get them up earlier, 
to make them healthy, wealthy and wise in spite of themselves."&g

  5) Set the projectile type used (v5) from the table in HELP PROJECTILETYPES.
 
&G Now the wielded weapon is done, but you need something to fire...&W
     NOTE: Please use projectile in the name, does not have to be in the short.
  1) Create a shootable object, for instance, an arrow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'projectile'
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take'.
  4) Set the damage range(v1 and v2) and set v3 to a type in HELP DAMAGETYPES.
  5) Set the V4 to match the V5 on the firing mechanism you created.
 
Don't forget to finish the items with weight, cost, long, short etc.
You now have two objects in inventory which are ready to fire.
Lastly, you may create a quiver for certain objects. To do this,
set the itemtype to 'quiver', and use v0 to set its capacity.
Be sure not to set the capacity too high, as quivers should be small.

1 'MITHRIL HALL'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50

Mithril Hall's creation is, like many other Realms of Despair, rooted
to Vl'Arescht's whim. Long ago, the Lord of Darkness created a shadow
dragon, which he named Shimmergloom, unleashing havoc upon the races
of Light. The fearsome beast, aided by might shadow hounds and dread
clerics, brought about thirty years of pain and sorrow. It was then
that the legendary Daskyn arose. This heroic man, whose name will be
forever remembered in song, drove back the dragon, tracking it back
to its lair in Garum's Gorge. There, the hero magically sealed
Shimmergloom in it's lair, unable to kill it as Vl'Arescht had blessed it
with eternal life. The dragon's rage was unending however, and it
summoned forth a torrent of servants, sending them to destroy the
peaceful settlements nearby. Our good King Welmar dispatched a legion
of dwarven berserkers to end this shadowy obstacle. With the aid of
the human Cattie-Brie, the dark elf Drizzt Do'Urden, the barbarian
Wulfgar and many others, the keep of Mithril Hall was founded, resting
near the steep cliff face of Garum's Gorge. The battleragers of the keep
maintain a vigilant guard, ensuring that the followers of Shimmergloom
shall never arise from the canyon.

1 'MORGUL VALE'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50

No race has plagued the battle for Light more than the orcs of Morgul
Vale. The orcish population ever-swelling, their incredible numbers
made it impossible to banish them all to their land, as was done with
many other singular beings of Darkness. After a dozen years of war, it
was discovered that an entity of pure darkness named Sauron led the
orcs with the aid of nine minions known as Nazguls. Further research
proved that this entity was very chaotic. A plan was made and executed,
where a party of orcs was led into some clerics of the Dread Lord Seth.
Without hesitation, the orcs slaughtered the dark priests. Lord Seth
took this as a personal offence. His fury was brief but deadly as fire
rained from the sky and Sauron was imprisoned in a strange, tangible
darkness. The orcish population was utterly devastated and the race
no longer has the numbers to wage war. The majority of orcs have
sought refuge in Morgul Vale, and the races of Light have grudgingly
given them ownership of this realm. Many adventurers go hunting there
for sport, yet very few who enter the Vale leave with their body, or
soul, intact.
~

1 MORIA~
Recommended level range: 5 - 15

The vast mountain range of Moria lies to the northeast of Koenraad,
spanning much of the northern landscape of Despair. Its twisting tunnels
and caverns house dozens of vile races who seem engaged in a perpetual
war to conquer this dark realm. These dread mountains also surround the
hated Morgul Vale, providing an excellent defence for what remains of the
orcish race.
~

2 MORPH UNMORPH~
&RSyntax:&g  morph <vnum> <target>
&RSyntax:&g  unmorph
 
Morph is an immortal command used to morph into various
things, while unmorph reverts the effect.
 
See also:  polymorph, morphcreate, morphdestroy, morphstat
~

800 MORPHCREATE MORPHDESTROY~
These commands are used for the creation or deletion of
polymorph data.
 
See also:  polymorph, morph, morphstat
~

800 MORPHSTAT~
&RSyntax:&g  morphstat <vnum|name> [help|desc]
 
Stats a morphed target by name or vnum.
 
See also:  polymorph, morphcreate, morphdestroy, morph
~

800 MORT~
.
&RSyntax:&g mort <level> (If level not specified will change to level 400)
 
This command allows an immortal to become a mortal. It should only be used
to test an area without having to create a new alt and going through advance
problems. Please use it with care, once in mort mode you CAN die.
 
Note: Please avoid saving and quitting while in mortal form.&D
~

0 MORTUARY UNDERTAKER CARL~
&gKara's Storm has two undertakers waiting to assist you.  They are
mobiles created by the mud to transport your corpse to you!
 
One mortuary is located 2 NE from In The Base Of The Council Tower
(recall for most players).
 
When you enter the mortuary, type 'corpse' and 'corpse retrieve'.
Carl will walk you through the process.  This service does come at a price
of 20 katyr per level.
 
If recall takes you to Dyrthianua's Teaching Podium in the Training
Grounds, don't worry.  She'll also assist you in getting your corpse
back in the same way Carl will.
 
This service is great, for example, when you've died to a spirit or
an aggressive mobile.  However, if you know where you died and how to
walk there, it would probably be a great benefit to do so.

0 MOUNT DISMOUNT~
&RSyntax:&g mount <mob>
&RSyntax:&g dismount

Mount is a skill, which allows you to mount certain mobs.  Being mounted 
on a mob cuts down on movement points that are used whenever you move.
 
New water sectors allow a person mounted to traverse them without damage
from drowning.  If you are in an area where your movement points begin
to drop suddenly and/or you begin to lose hps <hitpoints> quickly, you
should try to mount immediately.

1 MOVE MOVEMENT~
&gThis discusses the process of moving your character from one place in the
Realms to another.  The common movements are north, east, south, west, up
down, northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest.  You may also move
in these directions by the use of n, e, s, w, u, d, ne, se, sw, and nw.
If you need to pass through a door, at times they require being unlocked
and opened. To unlock a door, you type UNLOCK <direction or door name>.
To open a door, you type OPEN <direction or door name>.
 
At times, you may run out of movement points or require healing.  To allow
for faster recovery, you may SIT, REST, or SLEEP.  When are finished with
your recovery, and wish to continue adventuring, type WAKE or STAND.
 
For more detailed information on movement and doors, read sections 7 and
8 of your Adventurer's Guide book.

learn how to do it.

when it goes mobinvis; they cannot see it with any spell, it will be
completely invisible to them.
 
Be warned, however, that its programs will still function as normal, the
mortal will simply see a 'someone' if it performs an action or an echo

             mppurge <mob name>

             immortal command PURGE, but for one exception:
             there must be something to purge. If there is
             nothing to be purged, the command will log a bug.

0 MUD SCHOOL MUDSCHOOL 'MUD SCHOOL'~
&g
The Mudschool is designed for the TRUE newbie. It is a gentle, self-paced
instructional unit that provides information in little chunks, and immediate
practice of each new command. It is NOT a complete explanation of every single
topic of interest.
 
At the creation of a new character the player will be asked:
 "Are you an experienced MUDder?"
 
If you say "yes" you will be automatically boosted and promoted to Level 2,
and deposited in the Training Grounds. (The same location as always.) You may 
then proceedto train and get newbie eq as usual. If, for any reason, you do 
NOT wish to be promoted to level 2, simply type "n" and you will be deposited
in Mudschool and you can <recall> out to the Training Grounds and begin as you
prefer.
 
If you say "no" you will begin in Kara's Storm's Mudschool. The instruction
unfolds room by room, and IMMs and Angels helping new players might station
themselves in the first few rooms. Mudschool 3 is particularly useful as it
gives instructions on the 'say' command, so a new player is more likely to 
be able to talk to you.
 
Players beyond Level 1 are welcome to walk through the school and/or help
a friend get started. Please do not use the mobs in Mudschool to equip your
alts. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should players of any level bother, follow, or
tell to Level 1 players. They do not have the ability to reply or tell at
that level and it is very confusing to have someone say, "Hi, welcome to
Kara's Storm!" when you cannot see or reply to them. It is TOTALLY 
INAPPROPRIATE to offer to group with or bring equipment to these Level 1 
newbies. They need to complete the journey through Mudschool if at all 
possible. At completion of the Mudschool curriculum these players will request
promotion to level 2, and recall to the Training Grounds.
  
One CANNOT walk to Mudschool... it is much like the Sanctuary and the Arena in
that one types <Mudschool> to get in and <recall> to get out. There is no
connection to any room in Kara's Storm.
 
Please report bugs or anything amiss in Mudschool to the IMMs on duty.
Comments and/or questions may be addressed to SwiftSword.&D
~

1 MUDGRAD~
Congratulations! You now know the basics of Kara's Storm.
Review these terms and commands to be sure you understand them before you
venture out into the world. The Training Grounds should be your next
stop.
 
COMMUNICATION
'say' (shortkey ') speaks to the room you are in.
'sayto <who>' speaks to the target you select.
'nchat or newbiechat' is a channel seen mud-wide by those who activate it AND 
all newbies.
'tell' is a level 2 ability that lets you talk privately to one person who
may be anywhere in the MUD.
'channel' shows you your channel status.
 
YOUR STATISTICS
Your statistics show on 'sc' 'wo' and 'gr' to YOU alone.  'rep' shows to all
in the room you are in if they are awake. 'eq' shows what you are wearing
and 'inv' shows your inventory. Put things in containers by typing
put <item> <container>...get <item> <container>...exa <container>.
 
FIGHTING
'wimpy' shows and sets the hp level at which you flee from a losing battle.
'con <mob>' checks the success/death probability of a considered kill
'k <mob>' starts the fight...type 'con <mob>' before you type 'k <mob>'!
'autosac' automatically sacrifices corpses of mobs you kill, resulting in
rewards (money, spells) frequently, or occasional curses.
'flee' may allow you to do so.
'recall' will take you to Koenraad Square if you are not cursed. In a CR, 
you CANNOT be summoned from this recall area. Move outside the city.
'scan' shows you adjoining rooms.
'where <mob>' allows you to locate a specific mob. Try 'where dyrthianua' in 
the Training Grounds. Read room descriptions and scan to find the room.

0 MUDMAIL MAIL~

&RSyntax:&g mail read    all
&RSyntax:&g mail write

&RSyntax:&g mail to      <to-list>
&RSyntax:&g mail take    <number>
&RSyntax:&g mail show
&RSyntax:&g mail post
&RSyntax:&g mail remove  <number>

The mail command is very similar to the note command.  To write mail, as 
in notes, you must have a blank note held in your hands, and a quill or 
pen in your inventory.  Mail can only be addressed to real players, or 
'all'.  There is a charge for reading and taking mail.

To post mail to more than one party, use 'note to <name> <name> <name>', etc.
Note that any of the named parties can remove the mail before the other
parties get a chance to read it.

0 MULTI MULTI_REGISTER MULTI_REGISTRATION~
&g
If more than one person from your site plays the mud, you must each
register your alts with the immortals so that they can easily ascertain
that you are not multiplaying.
 
Each person is responsible for registering their own characters. The
Multi-Register team will not accept requests from any person other than
the legal owners of the character being registered. It doesn't matter if
it's "Your" brother or sister or school chum. If it's not yours, do not send
it to the Multi-Register team asking that they be registered.
 
To obtain this registration service, send all requests to:

  multireg@karastorm.org (Kara's Storm Multi-Reg)

  - List ALL of YOUR characters that come from this site.
  - Where you are logging in from, i.e, home, school lab etc.

You must do this for EACH new character you create as well.
 
Swiftsword!
~

0 MULTIPLAY  MULTIPLAYING~
Multiplaying is not allowed. Do not do it. If caught, you can be helled, set
back to level 2 and eq striped, or simply banned. Also, your second char may
be deleted, upon discression of the imm who cathes you. The only exception is
when a Host, Host Senior or Host Admin says you may multiplay, but this will
be very rare and usually for testing purposes.

1 MURDER KILL MURDE~
&RSyntax:&g  kill     <character>
&RSyntax:&g  murder   <character>   -- must be level 5 or higher to murder
 
KILL requires the first 3 letters of the target to work.
KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.
 
MURDER is used to initiate attacks on other player characters (WARNING:
see 'laws pkill' for restrictions on attacking other players).  You must
be level 5 or higher to be able to use the murder command.
 
It's not a good idea to try murder on anyone who does not have a pk flag.&D

-1 M_AFTAPOTH_~
...Suddenly, you are struck by a blue lightning bolt!
 
A Cherubim takes your hand and begins to pray in an unknown language.  Several
other join her and you are lifted into the air.  The scenery changes to a white
pristine palace.  You are then brought infront of the God Galley as she 
stands.
 
You suddenly fall to your knees as you have a strong urge to offer homage to 
her.  Galley then utters, "Pax Anima Abhinc Letum."
....You fall into a deep sleep.
 
You awake to find yourself again infront of the God Galley.  He smiles at
you and bids you, "Welcome Angel! You are worthy of my service."
~

-1 M_BALZHUR_~
Suddenly out of nowhere, a hideous beast appears, bringing with it the
horrible smell of brimstone, death and decay!

The demon gives you the most evil and spine tingling sneer that makes you
fall to your knees, and release your bladder... 

The next second, the immense mass of slimey muscle and claws is all over you
...shredding you to a bloody mess!

Mercifully, everything goes black as it moves its widening maw towards your
head...

~

-1 M_GODLVL1_~
...Everything begins to fade to black.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
indeed much more free than you have ever felt before...

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.
~

-1 M_GODLVL2_~
...You suddenly feel more confident and sure of yourself and your new
powers...

You feel that you have earned some trust and respect among your peers,
yet you know that your jouney has only just begun.
~

-1 M_GODLVL3_~
...You begin to feel light-headed.

Your hands begin to tingle softly...
The feeling quickly grows into a strange radiating pulse of energy! 

The tingle rises up your arms and into your head, filing your mind with
visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL4_~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

1 'NEW Koenraad'~
&gKoenraad, famed City of Hope, lies in the center of Despair's main
continent. The city has never fallen to the forces of Darkness and remains
one of Light's most fervent defenders. In fact, the greatest adventurers
of Despair originate from Koenraad, certainly profiting from the Academy's
excellent teaching. The Koenraad markets are always filled with objects
of wonder, and anyone wishing to join one of Despair's nine guilds will
certainly want to visit the City of Hope, for the guild halls are located
there.

1 'NEW OFCOL'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 35

The city of New Ofcol has grown so in recent years that it has been
reunited with its cousin, Ofcol. Now known under the common name
of Ofcol, the two cities form to make one of Light's stoutest defenders.
Guided by an ancient golden dragon and the Priestess of Ofcol and led by
Marshall Diana, the city's soldiers are feared by many of the darker races.
The only downside is the city's position. Located far to the northeast of
the Plains of the North, if any of the other cities of Light came under
attack, Ofcol would have great difficulty in sending aid quickly...
~

1 'NEW THALOS~
Recommended level range: 5 - 35

After the bloody destruction of Thalos, all of the citizens who had
survived banded together to create New Thalos. Far to the east of the city
of Koenraad and north of the Ishtar river, the city stands to this day.
The Great Eastern desert lies to the south and if you are far enough east,
you can hear the tranquil waves of the Sea of Sorrows lapping against the
shore. New Thalos is one of the five great cities that dares to oppose the
forces of Darkness. Several shops attract many tourists from far away.
The Sultan of New Thalos has joined with Koenraad and other cities in a
wholehearted effort to oppose the forces of Evil.

800 NEW_BUILDER~
&g
When you are promoted to a Builder, you are given a simple requirement to do.

You will be on probation for one month:

You will have 30 days, to build 30 rooms, 10 mobs, and 10 items.
 
You will be required to summit a concept to Khesekh and Swifty. Khesekh will
approve or disapprove or recommend any changes to bring it up to standards. You
must use a medival or fantasy theme in your area. Meaning no machine guns or
sports cars, or modern type things.
 
After the area you write is completed, the HeadBuilder or higher will eval
your area to judge its quality. If it meets Khesekh's standards and he judges
it acceptable, you will become a full builder. And your probation will be
considered complete. Also, if you need help, I expect you to ask one of us.
I consider it my job as well as Khesekhs and Nicoles to assist you IF you need
the help in building your area. IF you do not ask, I will assume you do not
need our assistance.

If your area isn't to our standards, you will either be demoted to a lower 
level Immortal, or you will be put back to a mortal. The choice will be yours.
Khesekh is working on standards and will be writing a help file soon.

Swiftsword!

-1 NEW_DEATH~
...Everything begins to fade to black.  You feel yourself leaving your body.
Rising up into the air, you feel more free than you have ever felt before...
 
However, before your deity comes to collect your soul, you feel a strange
pulling sensation as strange and colorful mists swirl around you...
 
&CA low voice fills your head with words of advice...
"When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the cathedral of Notre
 Dame de Sioux in New Koenraad; should you one day become a member of a
 clan, guild or order you will be returned to your own altar."
 
"Your corpse, however, is left behind where you were killed, together with
 all of your equipment, so that you can attempt to return to the scene and
 loot your corpse.  Your gold stays with you.  Corpses decay after time,
 and when this happens the objects inside will decay with it."
 
"Once you have chosen a deity and gained sufficient favor, you may be able
 to supplicate to your deity for your corpse.  Type '&Whelp death&C' for more
 information.  This message will appear only on your first two deaths..."

0 NICOLE~
&g
Slender as a human girl-child and seemingly not much older, the young drow 
appeared delicate to the point of fragility. Her black satin-skin gave her 
the look of living sculpture, an image that was enhanced by the supply, 
tightly fitted black leathers and ebony-hued chain mail she wore.  She was 
beautiful in the frey manner of elvenkind, with fine, sharp-features and a
cloud of thick white hair as glossy as moonlight on new snow.  Hers was 
a mobile face that could be one moment impish, the next coldly beautiful, 
dominated by a pair of large, almond-shaped eyes the color of Rashemaar 
amber.  These eyes speak of a restless intelligence, and an ever-ready 
supply of mischief.  Once you have peered into these eyes, you are forever 
bound to her.
 
 "&zDemons abound free upon the realm as I vision it's vast splender. Death
  and decay all but happen when I am around. Sammael and Iuno fight the

800 NOHELPS~
&RSyntax:&g  nohelps <all|areas|commands|skills>
 
The nohelps command will search through the commands, skills, or areas on 
the mud (or all three at once) and test to see if there is an attendant help
file which exists for them. If no help file exists, it is added to a list,
which is displayed. Helpful in finding help files that need to be created.
 
Note that if the keyword of the helpfile doesn't match the name of the,
command (or name of area, or name of spell/skill) then it is returned as
not existing. For example, the skill 'standard style' will show as having
no help file, even though there IS a 'styles' help file, in the stock SMAUG
release.  I only had about an hour, to code this, and it's not too smart. I
may try to make it more intelligent later.
 
If no argument is given, nohelps will default to "all".

1 NS NEWSCORE SCORE~
&RSyntax:&g score
 
SCORE is a sheet filled with your characters statistics.  When you type
score, only you can see what is listed there.  Should you want to let
others see your characters health, you can type REPORT.  
 
To get a breakdown of what each slot in your score means, read section 4
in your Adventurer's Guide book.
~

800 'NUISANCE STAGES'~
Stages of nuisances are the affects that the victim picks up while in
that stage.  As time progresses and the victim progresses through the
stages, they pick up new problems and the old ones gradually strengthen.
So for example if they are in stage 3 and progress to stage 4.  They
will feel more affects from stage 1,2 and 3 and pick up the affects from
stage 4. Power level is how hard they get hit with the affect. So if in stage
1 the affect was 2% of the time at power level 1 it may be 4% of the time
in power level 2.  And in stage 2 the affect in stage 1 may be 4% of the
time at power level 1 and 8% of the time at power level 2.
So with that being said here are the current stages and their affects:
Stage 1:  The Thirst Stage 
          This makes them become thirsty quicker.  The formula used is the
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is added to your
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is subtracted from
your thirst each time.  With 100 being not thirsty and 0 being dehydrated.
Stage 2:  The Hunger Stage
          The hunger stage works exactly as above except, the formula
subtracts 1 from the current stage becoming: (<current stage>-1)*<power level>
Stage 3:  The Mentalstate Stage
          In this stage each time your mentalstate worsens nuisance exagerates
the amount you worsen by. The formula used to compute how much more it 
adds or subtracts is: .4*(<current stage>-2)*<power level>.
Stage 4:  The Potion Stage
          In this stage you can not stomach as many potions as you normally
could without the nuisance flag.  Normally if your thirst or hunger is above
48 you can't quaf anymore.  Nuisance makes this a much lower number.
The formula used is: (48-(3*<current stage>)+<power level>)
So at power level 10, stage 10 you could only quaf 8 potions on an empty
stomach.
Stage 5:  The Wait Stage
          In this stage commands start taking longer to complete.  A
normal spell for example takes around 8-15 rounds of wait time.  With this
stage more wait time is added with the following formula:
(<current stage> -4 ) + <power level>    So at Stage 6 at power level 5,
each command would have an additionl 7 wait added to it.
Stage 6:  The Offensive Magic Stage
           In this stage you have a chance of targeting yourself with 
offensive spells instead of whatever target is specified.  The formula
for the percentage or the time you do it is the following:
(<current stage>-5)*8 + <power_level>*6  So at first stage 6 with a power
level of 5 you would have a 38% chance to target yourself with offensive
spells.
Stage 7:  The Defensive Magic Stage
          In this stage, if you are fighting someone you have a chance to
target them with any defensive spells you cast.  The formula used is the
following:  (<current stage>-6)*8 + <power_level>*6 
Continued in help 'NUISANCE STAGES2'
~

800 'NUISANCE STAGES2'~
Stage 8:  The Speech Stage
          In this stage you have a chance to scramble your speech and
scramble other peoples speech (IE what you hear from them).  This works
on a percentage with the following formula:
(<current stage>-7)*10*<power level>  So at stage 9 with power level 2
speech is scrambled 40% of the time.
Stage 9:  The Movement Stage
            In this stage you start moving in random directions like a drunk
does.  This is worked out in a percentage as well. Which works of the 
following formula:  (<current stage>-8)*10*<power level>  So in stage 10
with a power level of 4 you would randomly choose an exit 80% of the time.
Stage 10:  The command Stage
           In this stage your commands start failing (Like mentalstate).
This is done on a percentage of the following:
(<current stage>-9)*10*<power level>  So at stage 10, power level 10 the
character becomes utterly useless, as commands will fail 100% of the time.
Soon there will be more options, when they come in the help files you should
see are:  'NUISANCE' 'NUISANCE STAGES' 'NUISANCE OPTIONS'

&W&RSyntax:&g
      &cunnuisance  <victim>
      &cnuisance    <victim> [options]
&GUnnuisance will remove the nuisance flag from a player.
Nuisance will add a nuisance flag to the player specified by victim.
&wThis only works on pc's.  The optional parameters are as follows:
  &cmaxtime <#> <minutes/days/hours>&w
         &wThe maxstage of nuisance. Default is 8 days.
  &ctime <#>&w:  The time in days that the nuisance flag will stay on the
         player, once the time is expired the flag will automatically be
         removed. If this option is not used it will default to a permenant
         penalty.
  &cpower <#>&w:  A number from 1 to 10, 10 being the worst for the player.

&WNote the words before the options are not optional and must be used.

&RExamples:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days time 7 power 5
&GThis would nuisance mortal for 7 days with the maximum stage being
reached in 5 days, at a power level of 5.  Also note you can leave options
out:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days power 5 &Gfor example would set the
maximum time to reach the final stage at a power level 5 and use the default
value for the time.  Also options can be rearranged n like:
&cnuisance mortal power 5 maxtime 5 days time 7 &Gwould be the same as the
first example.
&GTo see info on nuisance level, power and set time of a player, use &WMSTAT.

&gTo see the objects you currently possess, type INVENTORY and EQUIPMENT
INVENTORY is the items you are carrying, but are not currently wearing.
EQUIPMENT shows you the equipment you are currently wearing.
 
You may WEAR, WIELD, or HOLD equipment to use it.  To stop using a piece
of equipment, you REMOVE it.  Before you may wield a new weapon, you must
first REMOVE the old weapon. 
 
You can gain information on your objects by using LOOK or EXAMINE.  EXAMINE
tells you the condition of your item, as a more detailed form of LOOK.

Recommended level range: 20 - 50

The city of Ocean Keep borders the Ocean of Storms, a sea whose waves
are in perpetual furor and whose skies are always dark. Ruled by the
Lord and Lady Willem, the city is a thriving seaport where justice

Recommended level range: 1 - 50

The original city of Ofcol has grown so in recent years that it has
been reunited with its cousin, New Ofcol. Now known under the name
of Ofcol, the two cities form to make one of Light's stoutest defenders.
Guided by an ancient golden dragon and the Priestess of Ofcol and led
by Diana, the city's soldiers are feared by many of the darker races. The
only downside is the city's position. Located far to the northeast of the
Plains of the North, if any of the other cities of Light were to come under
attack, Ofcol would have great difficulty in sending aid quickly...

920 OGGIES_AREA~
Oggies Area Concept&g
      The concept for my area is as I feel it fit, nearly 
impossible to run alone and a hell of a rush in a group.  It 
utilizes the idea of grouping in that it requires clerical 
healing and hard hitting damage.  Every mobile is designed 
to be slightly more challenging then the last.  Ayumi, the 
"boss" of my area is and will be the hardest mobile in my 
area, but as she is level 198 with over 25 thousand health 
points, she is nothing to laugh at.
      The area's theme is based around Ayumi, the mage.  She 
is of a weak birth, but she progressed to become one of the 
most powerful mages this world has ever seen.  She is a mere 
15 years old, and yet one of the most valuble test subjects 
the labotories have.  She, among many others, was 
genetically altered to increase brain capacity, and bulk 
power, something that could not be dreamt of with the normal 
Ayumi. Here, in this lab, there are many test subjects being 
created with the very real ideal that not all men were 
created equal.  A doctor named Randi both funds and runs 
these facilities.  May god save the souls of these mortal 
beings.
       Randi will be a secondary boss, for those who never 
find Ayumi hidden in a jail cell somewhere in the lab.  She 
won't be as powerful, but she to has become an experiment in 
this twisted place.  the total estimated size of the area is 
about 51 rooms, 15-20 objects, and about 20 different and 
unique mobiles.

to destroy the smaller villages of Despair. Many years of war passed,
and the ogre population slowly dwindled, until only a handful of them
remained. The savage giants retreated to their sole remaining village and
awaited annihilation. However, pity overcame the avatars of Koenraad
and they asked the mages of the Tower of High Sorcery to ensure that the
ogres lived in peace and no longer meant a threat to the Light. A maze of
mists was woven about the ogre village, simple to solve for any intelligent
race, yet confusing for ogres. The threat of the ogre race ended long ago and
very few visit, or attack, them.

~

1 'OLD MARSH'~

The old marsh lies far to the southwest of Koenraad. Once a part of
Haon Dor, heavy rain and lack of drainage created the murky bog. It
is populated by trolls and other vile beings who enjoy such a climate.
~

1 'OLD THALOS'~
Recommended level range: 1 - 30

Those who travel back in time to see the Tree of Life often encounter
the very beginnings of Thalos, when it was far more powerful than
Koenraad and was protected by Gordon the Brave, Defender of the
Light. The sights and wonders to see in this city are always too much
to tell by those who witness it, for it is a constant reminder of what has
been lost.

~

1 OLYMPUS~
Recommended level range: 10 - 50

At the Moment of Treason, the Lost Gods entered Es'Tilith and were
sentenced to an eternity of imprisonment.  To spite the Lost even
further, the Lord of Darkness forged two cities of the Gods, which he
named Olympus and Hades. Weakened forms of some of the Lost Gods
of Good were imprisoned in Olympus, while a number of the Evil Lost were
sentenced to Hades. Though these impersonations act like Gods, they
cannot even come close to matching the power of their true forms trapped
inside Es'Tilith. It has even been possible for these illusions to be killed
by powerful Avatars. 
~

800 OSET~
&g
&RSyntax:&g  oset <object>    <field> <value>
         oset object on
 
If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:
 
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done

1 PALADIN PALADINS~
&gThe Paladin
___________________________________________________________
"You are the most excellent of men and your lips have been anointed with
grace, since God has blessed you forever.  Gird your sword upon your side,
O mighty one; clothe yourself with splendor and majesty.
 
In your majesty ride forth victoriously in behalf of truth, humility and
righteousness; let your right hand display awesome deeds. 
 
Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king's enemies; let the
nations fall beneath your feet...
 
You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has 
set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy...
 
I will perpetuate your memory through all generations; therefore the
nations will praise you for ever and ever..."
___________________________________________________________
 
Paladins are warrior priests who draw their power from acts of righteousness
and strict adherence to the Code of The Temple of Solomon.  Their strength
in battle, combined with the ability to perform limited miracles is offset
by the difficulty they experience in perfecting their craft, and the penalties
they suffer when they stray from the path of good.

~

0 PASSWORD~
&RSyntax:&g  password  <new password>   <new password>
 
PASSWORD changes your character's password.  You repeat the new password only.
If you do not get it correctly it will not work.  This should end the typo
locking you out of your character.
The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged; it is
impossible for any immortal to in any way see, find or retrieve it.  It
is the responsibility of the player to ensure that the password of the
character is kept secure.
 
Passwords can not contain certain characters, or spaces.  We also advise
that you use an alphanumeric password (one containing both numbers and
letters) as they are harder to guess.  We also recommend that you choose
a password that is greater than 6 characters in length.  A good rule of
thumb is if it is in the dictionary, it is probably not a good password.
 
NOTE:  if you decide to trade a character, you do so at your own risk.
Immortals are not responsible for ensuring fair trades.  You may seek an
immortal to oversee a trade, but it is not their  responsibility.
 
&YThe password policy is:  password equals ownership.&w

it in the zMUD character settings as well as on the mud.  The MUD's command
for this is:  password <new password> <new password>
In zMUD, click on 'File', then 'Another Character', or 'File', then 'Open'
to access the character settings - and change the password there.
If you have forgotten your character's password but can still log on with
the character, you can still find out what the password is.  Log on with
that character, click on 'View', then 'Preferences' and then click on
General Settings'.  Find the checkbox for 'Gag Password' and make sure the
box is not checked.  Click on 'Ok' to close the dialog box.
Type the command #say %pass [enter].  Your password will be shown on your
screen, but not sent to the mud.  Write it down, for future reference.

800 QUESTITEMS~
&RObject Flag:&g questownpick
 
This flag prevents items that are meant as quest items to be given to
any other person besides an immortal. And they will vape when it is
dropped so transfer of items is impossible. Please note that this flag
should only be used for quest items such as tokens.&D
~

1 QUESTS QUESTING~
&g
Quests are run at random times for different groups of players within the
realms.  They may involve anything from a scavenger hunt, to solving riddles,
to killing mobs that threaten the Realms.  Quests are an excellent way to
meet other players, and enhance roleplaying throught the realm.
Different quests will result in different awards.  Awards are up to the
discretion of the immortal running the quest.
 
Some things to remember while questing:
 
 &W-&GWe are volunteers, and choose to run quests. If you have criticisms of 
    the quest, or the person running the quest, please be constructive and
    vent your concerns in an appropriate forum - in the Hall of Heroes located
    in the Koenraad Town Hall.
 
 &W-&GDo not ask when the next quest will be, or if there is a quest. Just pay
    attention to channels and what is going on around you.  If something out
    of the ordinary is going on, there's a good chance it might be a quest.
 
 &W-&GUnless explicitly stated, Multi-playing is &YNOT&G allowed during quests.
    IF you are caught multi-playing, you will forfeit any reward, and most 
    likely have a temporary ban from questing placed on the characters involved

0 QUEST_ITEMS SPECIAL_ITEMS~
&gNO player may pass or other wise allow another player to use special or
quest items, be it someone else, or be it their own characters. Discovery
of such happening will warrant the loss or removal of said item from the
original owner.
~

0 QUICKNESS~
&g
&RSyntax: &gc 'quickness'
 
&gThis spell improves the character's speed of reflexes and amplifies his or
&gher dexterity statistic. It is of the basic body-modifying forms of magic
&geasy enough for most characters below hero to grasp.
~

1 QUIT QUI~
&RSyntax:&g QUIT
 
QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room, unless that room has a prog that moves
you upon re-entry.
 
QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just
one command.  Nevertheless, it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you
get into the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, you may regret it one day.
 
There is no RENT here.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

0 QUIVER~
'Quiver'

&RSyntax:&g quiver <keyword(s)>

This skill allows an archer to create a totally unique 
quiver, that enables the archer to carry more arrows in 
the quiver then the average quiver.  In addition the 
keywords entered will become the keywords and short 
description for the quiver.  The quiver's level 
determines the amount of arrows that can be held within 
the quiver.  Rules for this is no abussive, or bad 
language, and no references to any drug paraphanalia.  
Violators will have the object taken from them. No appeal 
for this will occur.  

Example: quiver Kara's Quiver, and the name of the quiver 
and keyword(s) will be Kara's Quiver.
~

800 QUOTA~
&RSyntax:&g quota
 
This command show you the disk quota for the MUD.

          OR  <Complete>
          OR  <Quit>
          OR  <List>
          OR  <Buy> <item>
 
The Qwest command (along with one of the valid field) will allow you to run
quests from the Qwestmaster. You must be AT the Qwestmaster in order to use
some of the fields. eg. Qwest request.
 
Info - Tells you information you need. eg. What your qwest entails.
Time - Shows you how much time you have remaining to complete your Qwest.
Request - Dooes exactly what it implies. It allows you to request a Qwest.
Complete - Once you have completed your Qwest, you must return to the
           Qwestmaster and type Qwest complete to register that you have
           completed your Qwest.
Quit - If you are unable to do the Qwest then typing Qwest quit will remove
       the assigned Qwest. The punishment for quitting a Qwest is being unable
       to do another Qwest for a longer period of time than usual.
List - Qwest list will display a list of items which you can buy with your hard
       earned Glory points.
Buy - To buy an item you must be at the Qwestmaster and have sufficient Glory.

0 RANGER~
&gThe history of the ranger is as long as it is interesting. Rangers
were first used in the great wars as quick moving, lightly armored 
scouts during the ancient wars. Later, they were known as heavy 
hitting elite strike forces with extensive training in woodcraft 
and wilderness survival. In the peaceful years before the current 
era they were primarily caretakers of the forests and wilder 
wilderness areas near the big cities. In the current era of constant 
conflict and wars, the Rangers are great survivors. Rangers are elite 
troops after they have completed their training. Unlike normal warriors 
who are sped through their training with just the bare minimum of skills 
for combat, Rangers go through lengthy and vigorous training that permits 
them to survive in the wilderness without aid, to find their targets, 
hit their targets with great speed and skill, and fade back into the 
wild. While a ranger learns the trade of a warrior at a slower pace 
than the warrior class, they learn a great host of wilderness survival 
skills that permits them to be completely self sufficient. Later, as 
they complete their training they learn to utilize some of the forests 
magic, much in the way of druids, further mysticizing the Rangers to 
outsiders. The Ranger's capacity for enduring both melee combat and 
the dangers of sorcery on the battlefield makes them one of the most 
effective implements of destruction in the realm.

920 RAT~
&G
RAT
 
&RSyntax:&g rat vnum1 vnum2 command [parameters]

Rat, or 'range at' is the at command with the added parameters of two
room vnums.  Assuming the vnums are valid, your 'at' command will be
executed in every room in the range you give.
 
Example: rat 100 110 redit flags 0
This will clear the room flags in all rooms from 100 to 110 inclusive.
&w
&wGOTO
&w
&RSyntax:&g &Ggoto vnum1 vnum2

Assuming the vnums are valid, your 'goto' command will be executed in every
room in the range you give.   Now IF you enter a vnum already activitated,
nothing will happen at all. If it works and you entered the correct vnums,
you will end up in the last room Smiling like the Devil.

Remember to Thank Nicole.
 
Example: goto 25000 25199&G

1 RAVEN-TOR RAVEN TOR~
.
Recommended Level Ranges : 25 - 50
 
North and east of Koenraad lies the Mystic Seaport, where Captain Henry
sails to and from the lands of Duke Argyll Morgan aboard the sailing
vessel, the Sea Witch. Across the Sea of Tranquility, lies the quaint
fishing village of Glen Domaire. Further up the coast, is what is known as
the Wild Coast. Here you can find the Keep of Glen Morgan, ancestral home
of the Clan Dubh Glas, the fabled Westwood, and the Stonewall. The Stonewall
separates the Moors from Glen Morgan and slows the Scourge, which has ravaged
the Dukes' lands for generations. It is rumored that these marauders come from
the tower Dom Caligh atop the Raven Tor, the highest hill of the moorlands.
~

0 RAZORBAIT~
&RSyntax: &gc 'razorbait' <victim>
 
This spell makes the victim more susceptible to stabbing attacks.
~

2 RBEEP~
&RSyntax:&g rbeep <player>@<mud>
This will send a remote beep to a player on another mud, as well as
a message that you@RoD beeped them.
~

0 RBEEP~
&RSyntax:&g  rbeep <player@mudname>     - "beep" a player over IMC

rbeep sends an audible beep to another player on another mud (the @mudname
part indicates which mud; see 'imclist'). Note that this should only be done
when you _really_ need to get their attention; abusing rbeep will usually
lead to your IMC priviliges being revoked.

See also: IMC IMCLIST
~

2 RCHANNELS~
&RSyntax:&g rchannels
        rchannels +/-<channel>
Rchannels alone will give you a list of current remote channels that
you have, and using rchannels with + or - followed by the channel name
will toggle that channel on or off.
~

0 RCHANNELS RCHAN RINVIS~
&RSyntax:&g  rchannels                  - display your current IMC channel state
         rchannels +<channel>       - turn on an IMC channel
         rchannels -<channel>       - turn off an IMC channel

rchannels on its own will show you which IMC channels you have access to, and
whether they are currently on or off.

rchannels with an argument will turn on or off a given IMC channel that you
have access to.

rchannels can also be used to block rtells and rbeeps if necessary.

One additional option is rinvis. rchannels +rinvis will make you totally
invisible to IMC: you cannot be contacted by rtell, rreply, or rbeep, and
you do not appear on rwho. However, you cannot use any IMC channels while
rinvis is active (you can still hear them, though). rchannels -rinvis will
reverse this state.

Immortals may allow you access to IMC channels, or revoke your access to 
them, as necessary.

See also: IMC RCHAT RBEEP RTELL
~

0 RCHANSET~
&RSyntax:&g  chanset <player>             - see a players current IMC flags
         chanset <player> +<channel>  - set 'allow' flag on a player
         chanset <player> -<channel>  - set 'deny' flag on a player
         chanset <player> =<channel>  - reset allow/deny flags on a player

This command allows you to view or change a players IMC channel priviliges.
In all cases <channel> can be the name of an IMC channel (rchat, rcode, etc)
or 'rtell' or 'rbeep'.

Setting the allow flag for a channel allows that player to see and use that
channel, regardless of their level. This can be used, for example, to give
mortals with coding experience access to rcode.

Setting the deny flag for a channel prevents that player from using or
seeing that channel, even if their level normally allows them to. This can be
used as a penalty for players who abuse the IMC channels or rtell/rbeep.

Resetting the allow/deny flags simply clears them, using only the player's
level to determing whether they can use the channel.

800 RCHAT~
&RSyntax:&g rchat <message>

Rchat will send a message across the IMC network to all players.

800 RCODE~
&RSyntax:&g rcode <message>
Sends a message to all who can see rcode.
~

0 RCONNECT~
&RSyntax:&g  rconnect <mudname>                - start an IMC connection

rconnect will initiate a connection to the given mud. Note that this has to
be a _directly_ connected mud (ie. a mud in the first section of imclist).
Feedback on the state of the connection will be logged to 'wiznet imc', and 
you may want to check imclist to see if it was successful.

See also: IMC 'IMC IMMORTAL' RDISCONNECT
~

800 RDELETE~
&RSyntax:&g rdelete <room vnum>
 
This command deletes the room vnum specified.  Please be careful when using
this command as it will permanently delete the room.
 
Example: rdelete 1234
   This will delete the room with the vnum 1234.
 
See ODELETE, MDELETE
~

0 RDISCONNECT~
&RSyntax:&g  rdisconnect <mudname>             - terminate an IMC connection

rdisconnect reverses rconnect, severing all connections to the named mud.

~

1 'REALM OF WORSHIP'~
Recommended level range: 0 - 60

Very little is commonly known about the Realm of Worship, a series
of dark, lonely tunnels within the mountains of Moria. It was once the
residence of the Terror, the dreaded earthly manifestations of the Gods.
However, it is now empty save for the remaining guardians of Terror. Two
tales concerning this Realm's new purpose are being told lately. One claims
that the Realm now serves as a temple where the most desperate of followers
can come to convene with their God. The other dictates that the most powerful
Terror guardian has made a lair out of the dark tunnels. Whether these tales
are true or not, the Realm of Worship is wandered by only the most powerful
adventurers, and occasionally by those who seek a quick death.
~

0 REBUILD~
&RSyntax:&g rebuild <class> <password>
 
This command allows you to rebuild into one of 4 classes which
are unselectable in normal conditions. The following are the
classes available through rebuild and the level needed to rebuild.
&RPaladin         &w300(100)
&RSorcerer        &w300(100)
&RBard            &w400(200)
&RBarbarian       &w400(200)&D
~

1 RECALL }~
&RSyntax:&g recall <set/reset>
 
 Recall allows you instantanious transportation to a room you either set, or
 the default one, which is Koenraad Center.
 
 To set recall, use recall set.  It will set your recall to your current room.
 
 Recall reset will reset your recall to Koenraad Center.
~

0 'RECHARGE'~
&RSyntax:&g cast 'recharge' <wand/staff>

This spell is used to recharge wands and staves after use.  The mage
or cleric performing the recharge should always insure the item is
not fully charged, as overcharging is considered dangerous.  Also,
there is always a small chance of destroying the staff, or in even 
rarer instances multiplying the charges available.
~

0 REDFERNE 'REDFERNE RESIDENCE' 'REDFERNES RESIDENCE'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 47
 
After many aeons of seeming emptiness, the cloaking illusion of the fell
Sorceress Naris has been lifted from the building known unto men as Redferne's
Residence, or alternatively, The Stronghold of Naris. 
 
Redferne was a loyal knight paladin, true in both sword and honor.  Betrothed
in marriage to the lovely Naris of Thalos at a young age, they built a 
grand fortress and their lands prospered.  Naris, alas, dabbled in sorcery,
and as the years progressed, her soul was overtaken by the evils below.
 
When the fiend liches came to claim her body and soul, a mighty battle ensued,
in which Redferne himself is known to have lost his life.  Less is known of
Naris' fate.
 
The illusion of emptiness was in some manner related to the strange location
the fortress formerly held, floating in the firmament of Koenraad.  When the
spell was broken, the fortress returned to its location of old, behind great
dark gates in a quiet corner of what is now refered to as the 'Old Marsh.'

exname | <direction> [keywords] -- sets an exit's keywords
exkey  | <direction> <key vnum> -- sets an exit's key vnum/value
 
Note: Put a '+' before the direction to force ADDing of that exit
      and use a '#' to specify the exit by sequential order.

This command allows you to register your equipment. Though you must be at
the registrant to do this, it isn't hard to find. It is located in the Council
Tower. Also, please note that it will cost 1000 katyr to register. To get

~

800 REGLIST~

This immortal command gives you the list of all players who chose to register
their gear. This is useful for performing equipment reimbursements.
 
See also: HELP REGISTER.
~

0 'REIMB' 'REIMBURSEMENT'~
&gDeadly characters are never eligible for Reimbursements.
Experience can _not_ be reimbursed under any circumstances whatsoever.

The following are causes we will NOT reimburse for:
-- Loss of corpse due to corpse decay.  See "help corpse" for details.
-- Loss of corpse due to lag.
-- Loss of corpse due to problems with your system or the net.
-- Individual items lost due not saving your character regularly.
-- Individual items lost due to carrying items above your level.
-- Individual items lost because they were zapped or dropped on the ground.
-- Containers lost because they were left on ground or destroyed by a mob.
-- Weapon loss due to disarm before crash, reboot, or from a mob taking it.
-- Items lost due to hitting a death trap
-- Items lost due to scrapping by mobs or other players
-- Items lost due transferring equipment from one character to another.
-- Items lost due to not saving after looting your corpse and a crash occurs.
 
Corpses are now saved across crashes and reboots, eliminating the need
for most reimbursements due to corpse loss.  The ONLY cause for reimbursement
is when a corpse reappears in the game empty after a crash or reboot.

To apply for a reimbursement, post a note on the Immortal Board setting out the
circumstances of the loss and the five items you had prior to loss that you
would like reimbursed.  We will not reimburse certain items, such as gold,
potions, glory, clan items, or more than one weapon.  We will only consider
reimbursement requests made within one hour of a reboot or crash.  Only a
Demi God or higher may do a reimbursement, but any level Immortal may deny
one.  We will attempt to deal with the request as expeditiously as possible.
~

1 REKEY~
Rekey changes the keyword of an item.
It differs from rename in that it is not the name that is seen, but the
name the object is identified as and can be looked at or picked up as.
For example, if a sword of legend was rekeyed to blade , get sword would
no longer work with this item. (get blade would pick up the item)

   When an item is rekeyed, one of the words from the short description
     &GMUST&W be used in the rekey.
 
Rekey is included in the rename fee. See help glory for more information.
~

1 REMAINS~
&RSyntax:&g  remains
 
A worshipper may request knowledge on the disposition of their remains
from his or her deity (meaning the location and remaining time before
complete decay).  However, the imposition comes at the cost of a small
amount of favor -- approximately twice that of the character's level.
 
If no remains exist, there is no penalty to favor.

-1 RENAME~
&gA rename may be done by a level 920 or higher immortal. The rename can
be purchased with 20 glory or a rename scroll. Wedding renames are done
with a marriage license by Nicole, the Koenraad engraver. (See help wedding)
Renames are to be medieval in style for mortals and must not contain
the name of an immortal without their expressed consent.  Items will
not be renamed to machine gun, silly putty, etc.
Before contacting an immortal to redeem glory or scrolls for a rename,
please have in mind what you would like done.  You will need to consider
the following:
Short description - what is seen when the item is worn by a person.
Long description - what is seen when the item is lying on the ground.
Rekey - the renaming of the item (usually something from the short desc)

attempts to repair every item in your inventory.
 
There is a 10% surcharge for using "repair all". This surcharge is for

only command.
~

0 REPOP~
&gArea resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present.  Also
note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone
is in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' just prior to the reset.
~

800 RESERVE JAIL~
.
The "Reserve" command enables us to specify certain names that are
reserved and cannot be used by players.
 
We can specify names that we want to reserve because they belong to
former imms (like Narn and Dominus). We can specify names that are
often tried and are a bit of a pain (like Killer or Satan or Seth).
 
We can specify parts of names by preceding the string with an "*">
e.g.  reserve *goof
This will prevent any name with the substring "goof" ... like ...
"goofface", "biggoof" or "biggoofface".
All deity names should be reserved.
 
reserve                        list current reserved names
reserve joe                    add joe to the list if he's not on it
reserve joe                    remove joe to the list if he is on it
reserve *goof                  add the substring "goof" to the list

  The order that resets are in is VERY important.  You cannot equip
  a mobile with an object before putting the mobile into a room first.

  put into a room first.

This command is used to display, edit, delete, add and insert resets for
your area.

by a veil of mist. It is said to be a city of Lost Gods, similar to Olympus
and Hades. Some sages believe it is simply inhabitated by powerful entities
and thought elementals. Most adventurers will notice how they go unnoticed
when exploring the town, leading to the belief that only some of these 
entities are aware of what is happening on this plane. Below the city is a
flaming Lake of Fire. In the heart of this sea of flame is a fiery isle,
where one can enter the Underworld.

0 RIGNORE~
&RSyntax:&g  rignore                           - list current rignores
         rignore ignore  <pattern>         - ignore player(s) or mud(s)
         rignore notrust <pattern>         - don't trust player(s) or mud(s)
      rignore delete  <pattern>         - remove a rignore

rignore ignores or restricts the access, at a mud-wide level, everything
coming in over IMC for a specified player or group of players. Currently
two possible actions are possible: ignore and notrust.

Ignore means:

- rtells/rbeeps/rwhos will be ignored, and a rtell sent back to say that the
  mud is ignoring them.
- no messages from them on rchat, rcode, etc will appear on your mud.

Notrust means:

- any rwho/rfinger/etc requests from a mud/player matching the pattern will
  be treated as if they were from a level 1 mortal - ie. wizi imms will never
  be revealed on rwho, and rtells won't see them, etc.
- any incoming channel messages from something matching the pattern are
  stripped of wizi status - they will be visible to everyone in general.

Patterns can be one of:

  player@mud              - matches a specific player at a specific mud
  *suffix                 - matches anything ending with that suffix
                            (commonly used as *@mud)
  prefix*                 - matches anything beginning with that prefix
                            (for example, player@*)
  *substring*             - matches anything containing that substring

Use with care.

800 RONAN_OF_AVATAR~
&gRonan was an Immortal on Avatar from its beginning. In Avatar terms,
he came at the beginning of time and left before his time was due. He
died, at the age of 21, on September 3, 1999.

Tim, the man behind the Avatar Elder Immortal Ronan, was born with
neurofibromatosis, widely known as "the elephant man's" disease.

He fought his condition, in all of its various incarnations, with
courage and grace. He was able to attend school until junior high,
when it became necessary for him to be hospitalized more and more
often. After he had been home-bound for several years, even his most
steadfast friends visited less often and he turned to the internet
for social contact. He found good friends and a special niche at
Avatar, becoming a respected coder and an integral part of the
Immortal staff.
 
Despite thousands of tumors, literally too many to count or remove,
that attacked his hearing, sight, vocal cords, and internal organs,
Tim worked for Avatar, coding, and interacting with players. As the
disease progressed his vision clouded, tumors attacked his vocal
cords, his hearing, and his ability to sit comfortably. He had
blinding headaches, and still he sat at his screen, laboriously
typing with one finger, reading the largest type he could find,
keeping his connection to Avatar alive.

&RSyntax:&g  rquery <mudname> help         - ask for available rquery options
         rquery <mudname> <option>     - ask for information from a mud

RQuery is similar to rwho, except it requests different information from a
mud. Each mud differs in what information it supplies, but 'rquery <mudname>
help' will give you a list of options that you can ask for.

Typically at least the following are supported:

rquery <mud> who        - ask for a who listing, identical to 'rwho'
rquery <mud> info       - get general information on the mud, usually including
                          its address. This is the preferred way of finding
                          out the address of a mud on IMC - don't ask on rchat!
rquery <mud> list       - ask for a list of IMC connections, from that mud's
                          point of view. Identical to 'imclist' on the remote
                          mud.
rquery <mud> istats     - ask for some IMC statistics, identical to 'istats' on
                          the remote mud.

                                               to send you a rtell

rtell and rreply are the IMC equivalents of tell and reply, and work nearly
identically. To rtell, however, you need to supply both a playername and a
mudname (as shown in 'imclist'). rreply will reply to the last rtell you
received from a player - even if that player was invisible to you.

1 RUINS UMBRAGEOUS~
Recommended level range: 5 - 50 (pkill)

After the last Clan Wars, the gods looked down upon the ruins of old
Koenraad and shifted them into another plane, one that can only be
reached by those who follow a dark and shadowy path. Now decayed beyond
recognition, the shambled remnants of once great structures cover all
signs that this was once the prosperous center of Despair. Burning lava
flows through the city and moving shadows hide killers in their shroud
of darkness. It is said that those who venture through the ruins, and
lived to tell about it, that there are secret portals and passages hidden
within that will lead to the main plane of Despair. It is also rumored
that the spirit of Gravoc oversees the ruins, enforcing his own brand
of death and destruction.

hours before your own is auto-saved.  For this reason, you should not
rely on auto-save to keep your character updated -- save frequently.
 
Type SAVE immediately after recovering your corpse, gaining experience or
a level in battle, getting new items, making purchases or repairs, etc.
 
Some objects (such as keys) may not be saved.  You cannot SAVE and QUIT
with objects of a higher level than your own, as they will vanish when
you log out.  Every character is auto-saved at reboot.

a spell, or a skill.

than while sitting.  While fighting evasively, you have more options
than while fighting aggressively.
 
The ordered list is as follows, left to right, top to bottom:

survivor sought revenge against the Gith.  She devoted herself to the
practices of Infernalism in an attempt to uncover the puzzle of Time, hoping
to travel to the past and rescue her village.  As her studies progressed.
she became unable to control her thoughts and actions.  She came to
realize how to travel through time, yet her evil mannerisms aroused the
anger of Father Time.  The ancient lord banished her from travelling in
time forever because of her demonic powers.  Unable to complete her
quest, the demoness Malsangre now wanders the Astral Plane, slaying the
Gith and sending willing travellers back in time against her new foe,
Time itself.  In fear of her threats, the Father has generated a massive
defense to protect the sanctity of his realm.

0 SEL SELUT SELUTHI SELUTHIARY~
&g
 &RSyntax: &gcast 'seluthiary' target
 
Long ago, an ancient Heuv mage unearthed forgotten arcana of his
people that told of an art so powerful that it would change the
essence of the bearer's soul. Shrouded in ancient black runes and
written in a dialect long forgotten, the young mage spent the next
century learning the ways of the black arcana. When he emerged from
his temple, his eyes were devoid of color, heart absent of love, and
his pale body was covered with mystical ancient markings. Set into the
center of his forehead...a small black stone that seemed to pulsate as
if it was alive.
 
Returning to his land a changed man, the mystics attempted to exile
him from the land for releasing such a power. The Heuvian mage uttered
a single phrase that caused the mystics to freeze in their tracks,
"Seluthiary." What pain and torture they must have endured to slowly
watch a black force of energy envelope their souls.
 
This spell casts a strong black energy at your intended target.

0 SERAPHIM~
&gSeraphim are members of the faerie folk. They are one of the small
races. Their small wings give them the ability to fly. They are highly
intelligent and are regarded as one of the wisest of all the races what
makes them the best natural magic users. Thir small bodies are lacking
strength and constitution though.

800 SETBOOT~
&RSyntax:&g setboot time <hour> <minute>
     setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

This is used to set the weather in a specific area.
~

1 'SEWER'~
&g
Recommended level range: 5 - 30

Below the city of Koenraad is a series of winding passageways known as
the sewers. They delve deep underground, allowing great flows of rain
water and refuse to exit Koenraad. Rodent and large insect populations
roam the caverns, as well as serpents and arachnids. Some adventurers
also speak of an immense red dragon that has taken up residence in these
tunnels, though few believe them.
&g
~

1 SEX~
Please, do not bother other players with sexual references unless you
are in a suitable room. Yes, there ARE suitable rooms on this mud.
 
Rooms that are classed 'unsuitable' include, but are not limited to,
public areas, fighting areas, city streets, shops, etc.

There is an area which you may do this, it is located 2 west and north 
of Koenraad Square.  This area is only there to serve this purpose so
the other areas can be free from the activity.
 
This rule WILL be enforced.

0 SHADOWFORM~
&RSyntax:&g cast 'shadowform'

Entering Shadowform makes you almost untouchable by non-magical attacks, 
at no cost to your attributes.
~

1 SHADOWPORT~
Recommended level range: 10 - 50

Easily one of the darkest, deadliest cities of Despair, Shadowport is
an ancient subterranean town populated by the beings of Darkness. Its
entrance lies deep below the ground, in the darkest reaches of Koenraad's
sewers. Rumors say that there are many other entrances, but none have 
been confirmed. The city itself is ruled by Lord Xyranthas. Once recognized
as the greatest magi of his time, Xyranthas was turned to darkness with the
promise of immortality and unlimited knowledge. Upon his transformation to a
lich, he created the hideous shadowmists and formed Shadowport from rock with
incredible magics. Many an adventurer has fought his final battle here, and
there shall surely be numerous others...
~

10 SHARPEN~
&RSyntax: &gsharpen <weapon>

This skill lets you sharpen a weapon in your inventory; a 
sharpened weapon will land more damaging blows on your opponent.
In order to successfuly sharpen, you must have a high enough
dexterity and a sufficient proficiency in the skill. You must
also be in posession of a sharpening stone. An unsuccessful 
sharpening attempt may damage your weapon or your sharpening 
stone.
Of course, weapons without sharp edges can't be sharpened 
(for instance, bludgeons and whips).

-1 SHARRA~
'Sharra'

&RSyntax:&g Cuddle Sharra

The gross, the inferior, the bastards, they all are in 
retard of the physical beauty of this unworldly 
women.  Light glows from her smile and shade blossoms 
from her frown, what summoned this angel to our 
undeserving hands.  Sharra, queen, goddess, or myth?  
They all don't seem to be enough to stutter the true 
words meant for this perfection of nature.  May the 
silent be able to hear her words, and the loud, fear 
 
                               -An Avatar lost in Utopia

Example: Cuddle Sharra, This will get you to hear about how
you don't even like Sharra, because she said so!
~

1 'SHATTERED REFUGE'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 20

The shattered remains of the ancient civilization of tinker gnomes resides
here, to the southeast of eastern Koenraad and in the shadow of a fiercesome
mountain range. Inhabitating the tunnels beneath the mountains are the
gnome's perpetual enemies, and one time students: the hobgoblins. Similar to
goblins in many ways, they lack the intelligence and inventiveness of the 
gnomes. This is made up however in good measure with cunning and wicked ways.
This filthy chaotic race has made it their goal to rule the gnomes, and 
eventually all of Despair itself.

during daytime hours, between 7 A.M. and 5 P.M. and you will only succeed
in casting if both you and your victim are in an outdoor area -- you need
the power of the sun in order for this spell to work (thus it will also

1 SPAM~
No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to PUT A LID ON IT and force-quit you after the 20th
repeat of a single command
 
It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use
capitals to add emphasis to key words in a sentence.
 
Moving a large number of items into and out of a container in a crowded, 
non-store room is considered spam.  Using multiple characters to chat the
same message at the same time is considered spam.  Making charmed mobs
or pets to cause screen scroll through movement or orders is considered
spam. ANYTHING that causes excessive or irritating screen scroll can be
considered spam.

1 'SPECTRAL FUROR' 'HAND OF CHAOS'~
&RSyntax: &gc 'spectral furor'
&RSyntax: &gc 'hand of chaos'
 
&gAfter the Dark Mage Thanatos accidentally discovered the spell
'Disruption' in a failed attempt to create a teleportation magic,
he spent many years studying how to increase the pain that can
be inflicted by incorrectly moving a victim across the threshold
of dimensions.
 
 'Spectral Furor' is a formula which, by upsetting the very nature
of the space the victim inhabits causes neural as well as brute
physical damage.
 
With 'Hand of Chaos,' Thanatos perfected this line of magic, and he
returned to his researches on the art of astral travel.

1 'SPECTRAL GATE'~
Recommended level range: 1-2

enters the multiverse through the Spectral Gate. The strange journey
through this portal sobers the mortal and determines his demeanor
and nature. All know as well that once you enter the multiverse, you
may never return through the Spectral Gate.

0 STORY~
&gThree hundred millennia ago a sorceress rose to power. Her name was
Kara.  Several wizards stood up to fight her but were no match for
her.   Two years pass and Kara now controlled three fourths of the
lands.  Then, on a cold damp day three courageous wizards face
Kara in a final battle. The location of this battle is unknown.

"The depths of fire that whither time, her reach breaches thee..."
                                          - Ancient warning.

During the battle, Kara called upon a fearsome spell of unknown origin
and it caused a massive storm of ever changing mutations of the realm.
The three wizards were defeated and the world held in awe of the now
enraging storm. It was said that Kara was sealed in a tomb by the very
storm she created forever to be lost in time.

"...Tremble as one might, shadows midnight plight,
lost fortunes past, Her screaming last,
ages pass the land so turmoil,
justice not yet done, plagued the realm,
when She is found..."
                                   - Heuv poem.

Now, in the current time, the kingdoms of Koenraad, Heuv and Reyga,
rule the realm in a soft loving manor. The effects of the Storm, which is
now called just the Storm, can still be felt. Should another or the reawakened
Kara ever call upon the spell of unknown name, the results could be total
destruction of the realm.

"The murderous Ra are here upon this land and we are the
executioners...."   - Jedika saying.

Most are unaware of the intersecting planes of living here in the realm. Alien
in origin, the Ra found a refuge upon the plane Artium White found in his
travels. Several years after the Ra came, a new breed of warriors called Jedika,
whose origins are also alien, bring mighty weapons specifically designed to
hurt the Ra. The techniques of the Jedika are such guarded knowledge it takes
a special breeding of person to wield the right to the knowledge.

" Chaos and bloodshed, we stand in a world covered in
this a war of titans, this war is held only to resist the force
of evil, or shall we support the idea of our evil intentions?"
                                                  - Ragnos, the Legendary

We enter a realm covered in a chaotic storm, blazing in wonder, the
spell that caused this storm is known only to one person and she's locked
away in the core of the storm its self. An epic battle between the infinite
forces of the storm and the nearly infinite forces of mortal beings.
This battle is sure to continue for an unknown amount of time. Thus we
continue to exist, if the storm were to fade what would we be but the light
upon a dreamers eye.&D

1 STR STRENGTH~
&gStrength (STR in your 'score') represents your character's physical power.
 
The most common concern with strength deals with how much your character
can carry.  For each additional point of strength  you gain an additional
amount of maximum carryable weight.  Any character with 20 strength can
carry 500kgs; Warriors and Rangers can have a maximum of 25 strength, and
can therefore carry up to 999kgs when their strength is at its maximum.
 
Strength also affects (among other things):
 
 - damage roll and hitroll; for each additional point of strength, each
   of these will increase
 
 - chances of success for bash, stun, bashdoor, shove and drag, and the
   ability to dual-wield heavier weapons
 
Strength is the prime attribute of warriors, barbarians, rangers and paladins.
 
~

800 STREW~
&RSyntax:&g strew <victim> <coins>/<inventory>
 
This command is similar to scatter but instead of working on sending a mob
or a PC into the astral winds, it sends the victims money or inventory into
the astral winds. Use of this command must be carefully monitored as it is a
very dangerous command if abused.
 
~

0 STUN~
&RSyntax:&g stun <mob>

Stun is a skill which can only be used once a fight has started.  It will 
stun your opponent if successful.
~

1 STYLE STYLES~
Usage: style <style name>
 
Styles, when effectively used, can change the tide of battle. The more
experienced one is in a particular style, the better the chances that it
will work for the fighter's advantage. There are five different known
styles. Styles can be changed within combat to better ones advantage
and knowledge of each of the different forms of combat.

1 'SULFUROUS SPRAY'~
&RSyntax: &gc 'sulfurous spray'
 
With the incantation 'Sulfurous Spray,' the casting mage culls from
the air the elements necessary to form a strong acid which rains
down upon his opponent or opponents.  This strength and velocity
of the spray is such that it can work its way into various forms
of armor and clothing, and it is also able to harm opponents one
might think resistant to such attacks, due to its magical nature.
~

1000 SUMMERY~
~

1 SUMMON SUMMONING~
&RSyntax:&g  cast summon <character>
 
This spell summons a character from elsewhere in the Realms to your own
location ... and stuns your character.

Note: All deities offer corpse and recall, while object and avatar are for
particular deities only.

Deadlies may not supplicate for their corpse.

*** To be rid of an avatar, dismiss them. (help dismiss)

1 THALOS~
Recommended level range: 10 - 25

 
Thalos was once the most powerful nation in Despair, a constant thorn
in the side of Darkness, an ever-vigilant defender of Light. It was not
surprising then that, after another victory against Lord Seth's forces,
a magical black mist was unleashed on the city. Any who entered the foul
mist were dead within minutes, poisoned by the deadly vapors. When the
dark cloud lifted, Thalos was left in ruins, its once slavebound lamias
now deadly creatures. A beholder was left to rule over the wreckage.
None have attempted to rebuild Thalos, for they say it is cursed for
all time...
~

1 'THE ASTRAL PLANE'~
Recommended level range: 15 - 35

High above Koenraad, perched atop a heavenly rainbow, is the ever-
standing pearly gate to the Astral Plane. Once a gateway between worlds
and planes, it is now a black void which is connected to but one world.
The Astral Plane's inhabitants do provide much intrigue however, even if
their homeland does not. The githyanki, as they are called, were once humans
enslaved by the mind flayers of Shadowport. Led by the Lady Gith, they
escaped, yet their minds and bodies were so tortured that they were no
longer accepted openly among humans. Using new psionic powers, they quickly
dominated the Astral Plane. Since then, a powerful lich has become the
ruler of the race. None know the fate of the Lady Gith, although many
speculate that she lost or refused to fulfill a bargain she made with dark
powers to free her race...
~

1 'THE KEEP OF MAHN-TOR'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 35

The city of minotaurs, Mahn-Tor, lies on the continent of Antarctica, across
the lapping red waves of the Blood Sea. Most adventurers reach this land
through the ancient Blood Sea Portal. Named after its ruler, Mahn-Tor was
founded long ago after a dark, unknown sect created the minotaur race by
joining the features of bulls with unwilling humans. This savage race
eventually rebelled and won its freedom. In recent years, the minotaur race
has become much more civilized and though tempted to joing the forces of
Light, they remain in neutral in the war between Good and Evil.
~

1 'THE SHIRE'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 35

The Shire is a small village of halflings and hobbits to the northwest
of Koenraad.  The town is run by the Thain, who also manages the trade
of wheat with other towns.  Very little danger exists in the Shire,
save for the occasional thieving youth, or angry bull.
~

1 'THE TOWER OF ZENOTHIR'~
Recommended level range: 15 - 25

In the dwarven forest to the southeast of Koenraad is a small village
and tall tower. Residing in the tower is, of course, Zenothir, a famed
magician who made his fortune with the magical art of illusion and 
trickery. Other practitioners of this art have flocked to this tower and
founded a small village around it, although some say it is more a circus
than village. Although it is a well known fact that Zenothir has taken up the
cause of Good, these followers firmly believe that those who impress the
great mage sufficiently will be rewarded with his infinite knowledge of 
illusionary magic.
~

1 'THE TREE OF LIFE'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50

It was this Tree that the essence of magic weaved ages ago, after the
planes of the multiverse were destroyed by Dominus. From the Tree of
Life grew the beginnings of existence on Despair, from the lowliest
insect to the wisest of sages. Many have visited the Tree even after
its destruction by travelling through a magical portal which links
the present and the past. Those who return speak of many powerful
entities which combine many elements of life.
~

1 'THE UNDERWORLD'~
Recommended level range: 0 - 60

Far beneath the surface of the earth, beneath even the dwellings of the
dwarves, is the Underworld. Located near the center of the world of Despair,
it a realm of fire, brimstone and ash. Flows of lava are common and the 
heat of this dread place has been known to kill the weak of heart. Hideous
beings populate the Underworld, led by Satan. None know where she arose from,
though many speculate that she is a powerful entity with dominace over death.

&YChoosing a theme for your area.&D

A really good thing to keep in mind when you start out to plan your area,
is that it should fit within the theme and storyline of the MUD in general.
To begin with I urge you to go read the &Cstoryline&D which can be found on
our homepage: &chttp://ks.kyndig.com&D
 
Also bear in mind that this is a &WFantasy&D MUD, so not jet engines, nuclear
power plants, or guns. The only exception are the Jedika. I mean it. &ROnly&D.
 
The general storyline of the MUD needn't be all pervasive in your area, or
even present at all. But you should be aware of it, so you don't go outside it.
 
If you're making a temple, why not make it a temple of one of the existing,
ingame deities?
Think how the players would react if they actually see something that relates
to their character and the decision they've made on religion?
I'd personally rather see this conversation in snoop:
&w Player 1: "And then I went over to that stinkin' Ra temple and smashed 
all their icons. That'll show'em not to make fun of Sammael again."&D
 than: 
&wPlayer 1: "So then we went into like this temple of whatever and totalled
the place and got some good xp."&D
 
Am I just having a utopic delusion, or does the former sound cooler to you too?

0 THIEF THIEVES~
&gThe thief is a dark character which makes use of many skills often deemed
improper by the rest of society. Known to haunt the darkest roads and
alleys. The skills of the thief reflect his way of life, be it sneaking,
peeking into others' inventories, picking locks, or attacking from behind
with deadly backstabs. With amazing dexterity they have the ability to
circle around an enemy, but for living such a dark life, thieves have
always had a bad reputation so don't be suprised if you are always under
suspicion. Thieves start off fairly weak, but as they gain skills such as
backstab and circle they soon become dangerous foes.  A thief is always
useful when there is  a lock that needs pryed, or an item that one wishes
to acquire without detection.

0 TICK~
Many of the actions in the Realms are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in these Realms average 60 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 75 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present; Also,
some lower level areas have shorter reset periods, while some higher level
areas have longer reset periods.
 
Note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is
in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' or other messages just prior
to the reset itself.
 
~

0 TIER~
&RSyntax:&g tier
 
This command allows you to advance to the next tier. This is a hero command
and as such is not available prior to level 100. You must be at sub level 500 
to advance to the next tier. You can check your sub level by looking in your 
score for the number in the parenthesis after the word Level, or by typing 
who and looking to the left of your name. There is also a check if you already
belong to the tier you are trying to go. Chances are low that at sub-level 500
you will reach the next tier using the tier command. The higher your sublevel
is, the greater your chance at success will be.

the utopian flow, you can have the wrath of Urynaea down your back as 
you flee.
~

0 TIER-AVATAR~
&gThe avatar tier is where you will develope your skills to dual class if
you decide to. Also, you may get a chance to face the great Battle-mage
Lorur and end the war that is being fought on his plane, or join with 
him and finally quell the uprising. The choice is yours.
~

0 TIER-HERO~
&gThe hero tier is a staging point for those who achive great wonders and
pass the various things laid upon them in the mortal tier. The domain
of heroes lies on a different plane to that of Terra called White after
the one who discovered the existance of the plane. It is rumored that
the Ra have encamped themselves here and are staging an invasionary 
force.
~

0 TIER-MORTAL~
&gThe story of the mortal tier is vast and varying due to the great
wonders of the realms inhabitants. Most call this earthen domain, Terra
home from the rampagous Trolls to the mythic Dragons. Though Terra is 
now under perril from a mysterious invaders from another realm, most 
still call this domain home.

This tier is the first step towards your mastery of the Storm. Many an

called Angel. This tier is geared to helping players learn. The following
is a table of the tier levels and associated plane where they are more than

Your tendril of lightning hits it's intended victim with particularly
malicious ferocity. Torrent calls down a large amount of the magnetic
energy in the air around you at a target you designate with the collective
force of countless lightning strikes. The severity of the Torrent spell
is such that only very high level spellcasters may use it.

1 TOURNEY~
Recommended level ranges : 30 - 50
 
Forged through time and perilous blood and sweat, this gladiator arena is
famed for its prizes given to those proven victorious in the tournament.
Survival and fame, there is no second place within the halls of this
colliseum.  Guarded by once gladiators themselves, you will find that any and
all fighting is kept within the center of the arena.  Night after night,
thousands of spectators come from far and wide to witness the chilling spill
of blood and hopes.  You will find that within this massive and luxurious
colliseum there is no such meaning for the word mercy.

0 TOWER 'TOWER OF DESPAIR' 'THE TOWER OF DESPAIR'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50
 
The dark Tower of Despair has existed for many ages as a black spike 
that corrupts the landscape west of Koenraad. The God Strahd created 
this monstrosity, a gift to his most loyal servant: Orcus, Demon Prince 
of Death. The early ages of Despair were plagued by his dreaded minions 
and the undead walked the land. Orcus was without a doubt the most powerful 
evil in the Realms until he crossed the legendary Zarkas. Wielding the lost 
blade Nemesis, the Ancient Vampire Lord forced Orcus back to his abode and 
sealed the Lord of Undeath in his tower. Though Orcus is forever imprisoned, 
he still influences Despair to this day. Rumors, recently confirmed, tell 
that he has even managed to capture a solar, a being of pure Light.
~

1 'TOWER OF ENLIGHTENMENT'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50

The Tower of Enlightenment is situated near Lord Seth's Fortress, a
beautiful sight compared to the Dread Demigod's castle. Little is known
about this monument to knowledge, although many speculate that a tour 
of the tower can bless an adventurer with a crude understanding of the
multiverse. Some even say that the Infidel, Circe, has crafted under-powered
forms of some of the Lost Gods and sentenced them here to give adventurers
a feeling of godly might.
~

1 'TOWN HALL'~
Recommended level ranges: 0 - 60
Koenraad's latest architectural feat was in a sense, a prank at first.
The diety Elcid, looked upon the old Town Hall, and decided unto himself
that is was too easily accessible. So it was with his keen mind that he
created the New Town Hall. At first it was a maze of tricks and traps,
mostly harmless fun until Brontrel looked down upon this and instilled
Order unto the Hall. Now it is a place where all may meet and talk of
that which interests them. Many boards covering all subjects lie scattered
thought the three floors of the hall, along with meeting rooms where such
 
councils may be convened. Upon the first floor, the Mayor and the Judge of
Koenraad reside, and the top floor was taken over by the Symposium to
better relations between mortals and immortals alike
~

1 'TOWN OF SOLACE'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 50

The town of Solace lies to the northwest of Koenraad, attainable through
a path in Haon Dor. It is one of the five cities of Light and has fiercely
defended its territory for ages with the aid of the famed Mandor and Nelson.
An interesting quirk of Solace's citizens is that they do not believe in the
use of magic or the aid of the Gods. They are the meaning of the word warrior.
All are advised to keep this in mind when challenging the city's finest.

1 TRANSYLVANIA~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50
 
Transylvania was once a populated isle floating in the vast Sea of
Sorrows. Its people were strong and hard-working, ruled by an honorable
Prince. Its fate was decided when the ancient Inconnu elder, Dracula,
was overcome by a malevolent entity and abandoned his clan. It 
is thus that he came the Transylvania. The land's people slowly began
disappearing, replaced with vampiric minions and leeches. In the end,
the Transylvanian Prince fled, leaving the living that remained to die,
and then live in undeath. A small number of individuals still fight
the darkness in this hopeless land. The Count Dracula, as he is now
known, has taken up residence in a manor in the northern part of the
realm, commanding his minions from his lair. It is rumored that he has
been killed many times, only to rise again; for he is cursed and Vl'arescht
refuses his soul in all the higher planes.

The origin of all life on Despair can be traced back to the Tree of Life.
Weaved by the essence of magic ages ago, the Tree grew the beginnings of

visited the Tree through a magical portal leading into the past from the

-1 TROG TROGLODYTE~
&g
Troglodyte's (or Trog's) look somewhat humanoid, standing 5 ft. tall and 
weighing about 150 lbs. They have spindly but muscular arm's and walk erect
on their squat legs, trailing a long, slender tail.
 
Their heads are lizardlike and crowned, with a frill that extends from the
forehead to the base of the neck. Their eye's are black and beady and very
sensitive to the dimmest of light.
 
Troglodyte's are not especially intelligent, but their ferocity and natural
cunning more than compensate for this deficiency. They often launch bloody 
raids against humanoid settlements or ambush caravans in warm climates. They
guard their lairs agressively, lashing out at anyone who comes too near.

~

2 TROG2 TROGLODYTE2~
&gTroglodyte: Trogs are a reptilian race of humanoids that live in
subterranean places. They are quite strong, have above average reflexes,
and are extremely tough. They do however have a huge lack in mental
capacity. Because of these factors they tend to be ferocious warriors, but
when the rare spellcaster is found, they are not very adept at their magic
 
Trogs can be identified by their reptilian features, by the nauseous odor
they emit in battle, and by their very repulsiveness. Troglodytes are a
subterranean race, and as such have developed the ability to see well in
the darkness of the underworld.

0 TROLL~
&g
Trolls are generally found in rather uninhabited places, and vary greatly in 
their physical appearance. What they do all seem to have in common is that 
they are quite strong, extremely hardy, and have an amazing capacity to heal 
damage quickly. While not too smart, not too wise, and being shunned by most
races, trolls are not so bad as people might think, and can be quite a
welcome addition to any group.
 
Trolls are protected by their leather-like skin, and can utilize their claws 
to inflict damage in addition to using weapons. They shun direct sunlight 
however, and lose their incredible capacity to heal damage when the sun 
is upon them.

1 'TROLL DEN'~

0 'TRUE SIGHT'~
&RSyntax:&g  cast 'true sight'

~

1 TRUE TRUESIGHT~
&RSyntax:&g  cast truesight

the effects of the blinding attack still remain.
Truesight cannot be cast on anyone but the caster itself.

800 TRUST~
&RSyntax:&g trust <character> <level>

immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

1 'UNHOLY GROUNDS'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 15

As you walk through this hellish cemetery, before the graves of those torn
from life before their time, you can hear the mournful cries of those
left behind.  A bell tolls in the distance, announcing the passing of
yet another lost soul.  A preacher speaks from a shoddy chapel, giving
hollow words of comfort to the mourners gathered there.  The vileness of
this place permeates your clothing, attacking your every sense.  Ghoulish
corpses littering the ground, unholy statues with the heads of gargoyles,
and a vile mausoleum filled with bloody carcasses rotting away - these are
the visions which assault your mind.

and stronger then Uri.
~

0 URI~
&gUri are an ancient and very strange race. Some even believe they are
the oldest of the races to populate the realm. Not much is known
where they originally come from but during time they have become 
a familiar sight. The legends say that they were humans once but
long ago their mages experimented with the chaotic magic and the
whole race suffered a backlash from it that their mages had not
anticipated. Now they are lizard-like beings. The legends also say 
that their city that was once a great capital now lies in ruin and can 
be still found somewhere deep within the jungles.
~

0 URIAH~
&gUriah are an ancient and very strange race. They are one of the oldest
races that populate the realm. This lizard-like humanoids mostly live
solitary lives as they grow older. Their skin color changes slowly from

or blood cost to it.  Rules for this is no abusive, or bad language, and no
references to any drug paraphernalia. Violators will have the object taken from
them. No appeal for this will occur.
~

800 USEPROG~
&RSyntax:&g opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.

800 USERS~
&RSyntax:&g users <host ip>
&RSyntax:&g users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.

&gUvwyrn are a very mysterious, much-feared race that is shrouded in
mystery. By their appereance they can be easily mistaken for Dragons.
The Dragons and the Uvwyrn have been enemies for a long time which

have a more longer and rounded wyrm-like body. The Uvwyrn have
a razor-sharp teeth and thick, overlapping scales that provide natural

while they sing, dance and hunt. A single elf is involved in aiding

courts throughout the Realms and his insight has often saved many lives.

&g
&g
Vampires are one of the powerful creatures of the Realms.  Being a creature
of the undead, they require copious quantities of fresh blood.  Instead of
using mana, Vampires use blood points (bp) for spell casting.  If a Vampire
takes a large amount of damage, Blood points will be lost, but, Blood points
can give a small surge of hit points (hp) in battle when needed.  As a undead
creature of the night, Vampires receive an armor class (ac) bonus at night,
a time when they can use the skill mistform.

1000 VAMPIRE2~
&gEl Eliminati is a vampire cult which formed during
the 15th century, a time when dueling and swordsman-
ship were popular among humans. They continue to carry 
the long and short swords of that era even though the 
hey-day of the cult is past. Their numbers dwindled due
to anti-vampire activity and their penchant for getting
beheaded in sword fights. They eventually put themselves
into the service of the demon Balthazar, who brought them
to Kara's Storm. Around 1899, they were all driven out of
the Hellmouth, and now are back.

800 WATCH~
. &w
&W &RSyntax:&g &G watch                  &W Shows you a help screen
&W &RSyntax:&g &G watch size             &W Shows the size of your watch file
&W &RSyntax:&g &G watch clear            &W Deletes your watch file
&W &RSyntax:&g &G watch show             &W Shows all your active watches
&W &RSyntax:&g &G watch player <name>    &W Starts watching a player
&W &RSyntax:&g &G watch site <site>      &W Starts watching all players from site
&W &RSyntax:&g &G watch delete <number>  &W Stops a watch
&W &RSyntax:&g &G watch print 1          &W Shows file starting at line 1
&W &RSyntax:&g &G watch print 500        &W Shows file starting at line 500
&W &RSyntax:&g &G watch print 500 100    &W Shows 100 lines starting at line 500

Watch will work 24 hours a day from the time you put a watch on a player until
you take it off. You can also watch all players from a specific site.
 
We need you to be real careful about the size of your watch file. If you
are watching a number of players or sites, please do not just forget about
your watches and allow your watch file to grow to outrageous sizes. You
should never have more than 5,000 or 10,000 lines in your watch file.
If you are doing some watching, be sure you check your watch file daily
and either print it, display it, copy it to your hard drive or do whatever
you need to do with it but then ... please ... please ... be sure you
clear it so that it don't grow huge and eat up all our hard drive space.
If you clear your watch file daily ... there should be no problem. If you
aren't watching anyone ... you don't have to worry about this. But if you
start a watch, it is your responsibility to know how big your watch file
is and to stop the watch when you no longer need it. The command
&G"watch size" &W tells you how many lines are in your watch file.
The command &G"watch clear"&W clears (deletes) your watch file.
For the time being the maximum number of lines you can display at one time
is 1000. So ... even if you have 5,000 lines in your watch file ... you can
only display 1,000 at a time.

Remember.. damage will also be modified by DR stats....

1 WEAPONS~
Weapons are the primary source of fighting power for most classes,
especially at lower levels where other skills and spells remain
unlearned. To use a weapon, simply 'wield <weapon name>'. You will
hit more frequently with a weapon which is suited to your class, so
choose your weapon wisely. For instance, mages use short blades at 95%
efficiency. A mage wielding a long blade would hit his/her target less
frequently, dependant upon the hitroll of the weapon in hand. Also, be
sure to practice and adept your favored weapontype for best results.
~

0 WIELD WEAR~
&RSyntax: &gwear <&Pobject&g>
&RSyntax: &gwield <&Pobject&g>
 
WEAR places an &Pobject&g from your inventory into
the appropriate slot of your equipment and you become

effectively wield.
 
You cannot wield or wear the item if your level is

&RSyntax:&g  wimpy
&RSyntax:&g  wimpy <value>
&RSyntax:&g  wimpy max

attempt to flee.
                                                      
'Wimpy' by itself sets your wimpy to about 20% your maximum hitpoints.
 
'Wimpy <value>' allows you to set your wimpy at a level you determine,
but it cannot exceed about 75% of your maximum hitpoints.
 
'Wimpy max' sets your wimpy at its maximum level for you.
 
Some monsters are wimpy.

1 WIS WISDOM~
Wisdom (WIS in your 'score') represents your character's wisdom and ability
to incorporate learning.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - the number of practices a character gains each time it levels
 
 - the mana a character gains each time it levels, though intelligence
   affects this much more heavily
 
 - the percentage a character learns of a new language at each practice,
   though intelligence affects this slightly more
 
 - the ability to remove a trap or poison a weapon
 
Wisdom is the prime attribute of druids and clerics.

&OWelcome!&D
 
To the new and exciting world of a Builder, or Wizards as we call them here.
You're about to embark on a glorious adventure, which like all good adventures 
will cause a lot of hair pulling, growling and moping.
You're going to Build your very own dream area!
But before you do that, I need to make sure you're making something you're 
committed to.
 
Write me a concept of your area. Tell me what you want to build. 
&WSell me the idea.&D
Then you get more vnums than your probationary lot. No idea, no more vnums.
 
Vnums generally come in blocks of 100 - probation vnums excepted.
If you have a Concept, then you most likely also have a clue as to how many
rooms, objects and mobs you'll need.
To begin with, you'll be assigned equal shares of all three.
 
When you're forming your dream out of raw chaos, ie when you're Building, 
there're a few things I'd like for you to observe:
 
&cRoom descriptions should contain the word 'you' as little as possible.&D
&CExtra descriptions (ED) of notable features that aren't objects or mobs add 
flavour, as does roomprogs. The latter aren't mandatory though.&D
Make descriptions of mobs! They don't seem all that impressive if they're 
nothing special to look at. 
&YThis also goes for objects. They should have a Long description, a Short
description and preferably a Desc as well.&D
Make the players see the beast, the weapon, the armour, the whazzit, rather 
than just the numbers change on their score.
 
More to come..

920 WIZARDS2~
&cSee also HELP NEW_BUILDERS
&OContinued from Help Wizards.&D
 
&YItems/Objects&D
Please be sure to read all relevant help files to item/object creation.
These include ITEMVALUES, ITEMTYPES, WEAPONTYPES, LEVERFLAGS, etc.
 
Most people tend to ignore or forget poor v7 on their objects.
Please set this for all critical objects, such as keys. It's the level
the item will load as, no matter the level of the mob.
Imagine you're in a group of friends that have finally conquered the great
beast and the great beast's corpse rewards you with the bone key for the
treasure room. Except no one in the group can pick up the key, because the mob
and thereby the key is too high level!
&CAvoid this. Set v7 on objects like the key.&D
&rOn the other claw, if you don't want lowlevels to run off with gear from
a highlevel mob, don't set it, and the gear will be the same level as the mob
loading it.&D
Also, please remember to set the Wear Flag properly. It won't be any good to
have an incredibly versatile object that can be wielded, held, or worn around
the neck, if the players can't TAKE it. Know what I mean?
 
&YMobs&D
As with Objects, make sure you've read the relevant help files.
These include ACTFLAGS/MOBFLAGS, BODYPARTS, RIS, etc.
 
There are some flags that should only be used sparingly in creating your mobs.
While it will be great fun indeed - &gto you&D - to have every mob in your area
Block the passage of players, it will get old and frustrating seen from the
players' point of view really fast. Thus that flag shouldn't be used more than
two or three times in a 100 room area.
You'll need to explain why you want more in your concept, if you don't want 
the flag to go missing all of a sudden.
 
&YRooms&D
As with Mobs and Objects, make sure you've read the relevant help files.
These include ROOMFLAGS, EXITTYPES, EXFLAGS, SECTORTYPES, etc.
 
I know, it sounds terribly cool to have your room set with the &rbloodroom&D
flag, but it doesn't really mean what you think it does. If you know what it
means, then you'll know why it shouldn't be set in more than a few ultra-rare
rooms. If you don't, I ask you to accept the dictate that it shouldn't be.

&YYour Area.&D
Isn't it exciting?
The three things mentioned earlier join nicely to form up what makes...
an area! Wow! You're making an area.
That's right you are. Question is, do you know what level range you're
making it for?
&WChances are, you've already been instructed on setting a level range.&D
 
It may not be the Ultra-Power Realm of Doom you wanted to create.
Especially not if it's your first. Before you sit and sulk over that,
think of this: &CHow are the players ever going to be high enough level to
have any fun in your area, if they can't level anywhere from scratch?&D
&rDon't leave it up to me or the HeadBuilder to make the lowbie areas.
Then we get cranky, and while I can't speak for the HeadBuilder, you
don't want me cranky.&D
 
&YMob levels?&D
What levels should your mobs be? Well, consider this:
&CWhat levels of players do you want to gain experience in your area?&D
 
Once you've established this, here's a nifty little formula for setting the
level range on your mobs (courtesy of SwiftSword bow-and-say-thank-you):
&PTake the lowest level of player you want to gain exp in your area, and
subtract four (4). That's the lowest level a mob can be and still be
worth the while to a player within the level range for your area.&D
&RNow take the - you guessed it - highest level of player you want to gain
exp in your area and add nineteen (19). Any mob higher than that won't
give players within the area's level range anything.&D
 
Alternatively, if you want to narrow down the range of levels to which your
area is attractive, subtract 4/add 19 to the average (round down) for
your lowest level and highest level respectively.
&WDo only this if you're working with a narrow range already, eg 10 levels&D
 
That's the way it is. That's how the formula works. Adhere. Comply.
 
More advanced options for your area will follow..

800 WIZINFO~
&RSyntax:&g wizinfo
 
This command displays the contact information for Immortals.
~

800 WIZINVIS~
All immortals have the responsibility to be available to others whenever
possible, be they mortal or immortal.  When the use of wizinvis is called
for, the following are parameters for its use:
 
 - Immortals level 51 through 54 should be visible at all times, save
   for when snooping, running a quest or some similar circumstance.
 
 - Immortals level 55 and up may invis to any level at their discretion.
 
Guidelines for use of wizinvis by 55 and higher:
It is considered mandatory to be visible to all other immortals whenever
reasonably able to do so.  Using wizinvis beyond 51 to facilitate work on
a project, allow concentration on something, avoid excessive tells or the
like is fine, but it should only be used while necessary.
 
Guidelines for use of wizinvis beyond 51 in immortal channels:
Sightings of Someones in immortal channels should be kept to a minimum.
If you are free enough to be able to use an immortal channel, you should
be visible to the lowest immortal in that channel; no higher than 54 in
Muse, no higher than 51 in immtalk, etc.  Being a Someone to anyone on
an immortal channel should only occur if you're too tied up to go
visible but need to make a comment.
 
The same applies to all situations using channels, tells or actions.
Avoid being a Someone to mortals and immortals alike unless you have
a good reason to do otherwise.

0 WYRM~
.
&gWyrms are legendary and mystical  reptilian creatures that, in time,
can become some of the most powerful creatures in the realm. A full
grown wyrm stands taller than any other race, is covered with protective
scales, has large leathery wings, a powerful tail, long sharp claws, and
the ability to utilize a distinctive breath weapon against their opponents.
Wyrms are both physically powerful and adept at magic. They tend to 
excel at every endevor, but while they may be strong, they really progress
in power quite slowly.
~

0 WYVERN 'WYVERN TOWER' 'WYVERNS TOWER'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 30
 
Crafted ages ago from the black magics of an evil cult, the Wyvern's Tower
was conquered two decades ago by the forces of Light. They set the tower on 
fire and left, believing that holy fire would finish the deed of purging the 
evil of the place. However, only months after, many races of Darkness began 
creeping back, making the tower's hallowed halls their home once again. The 
forces of Light, unfortunately, have not the time to deal with such minor 
threats. So, a group powerful enough to completely destroy the creatures 
within the tower has never risen to the challenge. The Wyvern's Tower has 
been used of late for training and testing of new initiates of Good.
